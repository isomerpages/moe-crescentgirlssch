### **CG65 6.5KM Virtual Cross Country**
With all the restrictions brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic, it seemed like 2021 was going to be another year without our Sports Carnival or Cross Country. However, with some innovation and careful planning, we were blessed to be able to continue our biennial Cross Country despite the current situation.  
  
In celebration of the school’s 65th year of founding, instead of the usual 3.2km run, it became a 6.5km run that could be split up into a maximum of 4 runs. Students were encouraged to record their runs using the ‘Nike Run Club’ application and then submit a screenshot of their runs through an online form. Staff and teachers were also involved as they formed teams of 5 to complete 65km together.  
  
To encourage everyone virtually, the House Leaders created various videos to remind and motivate everyone to take action. Attractive prizes, such as a uniquely designed CG65 finisher’s medal, top 10 trophies, House points as well as class Gotchas were up for grabs, helping to further motivate everyone to take part.  
  
Finally, after the challenge period was over, the House Leaders came together over a few weeks to collate and verify the results. At the end of the day, the school came together to complete over 5,000km in distance!  
  
Just as the old saying goes, “Where there is a will, there is a way”. We are thankful to be able to find a way to continue our Cross Country run even if we were unable to run together physically as a school.
