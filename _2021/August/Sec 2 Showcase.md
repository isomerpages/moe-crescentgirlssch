### **Sec 2 Showcase**
My experience in Crescent over the past 2 years has been a very fulfilling one. I made many new friends and created unforgettable memories with my classmates. I will always remember the Secondary One Orientation. Our Orientation Group Leaders were very welcoming and friendly. We had exciting events lined up ahead of us, including the campfire. It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience preparing for the class cheers and playing games like CrezMonopoly. We had many opportunities to bond with each other during events unique to Crescent as well, such as the Crezunite week and Champion seminar. The frequent competitions throughout the year for National Day, Racial Harmony Day and Chinese New Year gave the class a chance to bond and collaborate through sharing ideas and filming together.

Crescent also has programmes including the Integrated Curriculum that taught me many 21CC skills such as skilled communication and critical thinking. The use of Personal Learning Devices and attending the Lower Secondary Computer Education Programme (LSCEP) lessons have taught me much about technology and its applications. The teachers here are extremely understanding and relatable. Instead of the lecture-style classes, our lessons are engaging and interactive as we have discussions and debates on topics. Students from sports CCAs have training three times a week. Even though it can be tiring at times, our coaches and teachers-in-charge provide us with fun activities to hone our skills.

Overall, my experiences are fun and enriching, experiences which I will cherish for a long time to come.
