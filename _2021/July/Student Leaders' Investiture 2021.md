### **Student Leaders’ Investiture 2021**

On 29 June 2021, the 8th Student Leaders' Investiture was held in the comfort of our own classrooms, in light of the evolving CoViD-19 situation. Probation student leaders were warmly welcomed into their respective leadership groups and our Secondary Four leaders stepped down after serving the school with their invaluable contributions.  
  
This year's theme was Ohana which means ‘family’ in Hawaiian, where everyone supports one another through thick and thin. It is a good reminder that even amidst challenges, our Crescentian family is one that is bonded, where students continue to support and cheer one another on.  
  
The newly minted leaders felt proud of themselves for how far they have come in their leadership journey, as they were presented with their respective badges, ties, and lanyards. The Secondary Four student leaders also received their due recognition for all the good work done, and appreciation messages for their contributions from Crescentians were also flashed on the screen.  
  
Despite the investiture being held in a different format, the experience was nonetheless meaningful and heartwarming, and we have definitely fostered stronger bonds with one another.  
  
As newly minted leaders ourselves, we truly feel blessed to have been invested and will continue to embark on our leadership journey, bearing in our hearts and minds the true calling of leadership. We will use our conviction to enable us to remain true to our common desire to serve and lead, and practice the values of the student leadership pillars and our PERMAH domains.
