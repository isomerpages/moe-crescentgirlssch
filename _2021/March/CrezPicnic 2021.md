### **CrezPicnic 2021**
Crescent Crezunite Mass Picnic was an event Crescentians highly anticipate. Every year, Crescentians count down to this day to share their mouth-watering food and sit in a big circle, facing all their friends to have a blast! It is indeed a day to look forward to for good company and food.

However, the mass picnic would be a little different this year in terms of having to say goodbye to sharing large, cheesy pizzas and passing around spicy potato chips due to the ongoing pandemic. With SMM in place, students only ordered individual food and sat in their respective classes, keeping to their designated groups of six.

This did not stop us from having a whale of a time! Music roared through the class as we swayed to the beat. All of us collectively wore the beautifully crafted Crezunite t-shirts that reflected our unity even during challenging times. We ate our tantalizing meals and rejoiced at the sight of the sweet, cool, dessert sponsored by the school - ice-cream! The warm ambiance in our classrooms could lift anyone's spirits up! Laughter was heard as we snapped photographs of each other while being a metre apart. It is a pity that we were unable to experience the authentic Crescent mass picnic this year, but even if this was different, it was not any less significant. We can all agree that the afternoon of the 30th of March would be a part of the many unforgettable memories we made during our Crezunite week in 2021.
