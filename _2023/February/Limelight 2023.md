### **Limelight 2023** ###

After a two-year long hiatus due to the pandemic, the Crescent Girlsâ€™ School Symphonic Band (CGSSB) was once again given the opportunity to perform our 11th Limelight concert at the Esplanade Concert Hall on the 23rd of February this year.

Limelight is a series that gives some of the best school choirs and symphonic bands in Singapore an opportunity to perform at Esplanade. It hopes to inspire excellence in students by providing them a platform to showcase their musical abilities to the public.

We were all very excited and practiced hard every week for Limelight as we wanted to do our best for the concert and share good music with the audience. On the day of the concert, everyone was nervous, as it had been some time since we had performed for the public. Furthermore, since all CCA practices were held online for the past few years, we felt like we would not be able to play our best, as we lacked the confidence. However, after listening to the encouraging words of our conductors and teachers, we were determined to do our best at the concert and enjoy ourselves in the process.

At the end of the concert, all of us felt proud of ourselves and thought Limelight was a rewarding and fun experience.
