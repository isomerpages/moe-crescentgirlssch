#### Secondary 1 Outdoor Adventure Learning Camp ####

The purpose of this camp was to provide an environment for us to develop social and decision-making skills. It also provided us with the golden opportunity to explore the outdoors. During this amazing and fun-filled outdoor adventure, we learnt to work as a team and honed our coordination skills through the bonding activities.

On the first day, after an introduction to camp life, we got to explore the outdoors. I personally loved the breath-taking and peaceful nature surrounding us. It was totally different from the daily city-life that I experienced. Replacing buildings were rich flora and fauna. We did fun cheers such as the “Makan Cheer” where we got to cheer for our food before eating. The instructors there raised our spirits by letting the loudest classes eat first. All the classes were extremely enthusiastic and cheered as loudly as possible. After all, who wouldn’t want a delicious and satisfying meal after a long day of activities? After lunch, we learnt how to pitch tents. Although initially challenging, we worked together as a class and eventually pitched the tents successfully. Teamwork indeed made the dream work! The most memorable part of this activity was when we got to sleep in these tents! Though it was not as comfortable as our warm and soft beds, we got used to it and even enjoyed the experience.

At the end of the camp, I felt like I had picked up many new outdoor skills which I vowed to put into use in the future. The overall camp experience was very thrilling and fruitful. I am definitely looking forward to another camp in the future.
