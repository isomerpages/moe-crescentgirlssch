### Secondary 3 Outward Bound Singapore (OBS) ###

&nbsp;My experience in OBS was extremely challenging. That said, it was also fun-filled and memorable. At first, I was consumed by apprehension as spending five days in the wild with strangers sounded like a harrowing feat. However, my watch-mates and I quickly warmed up to each other, and they proved to be caring and reliable. Throughout the course of five days, we experienced many mentally and physically challenging feats, such as kayaking for 6 hours in the scorching sun and hiking for long distances in the woods while carrying heavy bags. With the added obstacle of heavy rain that week, we were always completely drenched in rainwater by the end of the day, leaving us cold and fatigued. However, my watch-mates and I constantly supported each other through pep talks and words of encouragement. During the hike, some even offered to carry the backpacks of others to lessen their load. Seeing how my fellow watch-mates were ever ready to extend a helping hand to those in need, I felt extremely touched. Even though I wanted to give up at times, witnessing the grit and determination of my fellow friends motivated me to muster up the energy to complete the hike. “While values may be taught in the classroom, they only gain through meaning through real life experiences.” My experience in OBS definitely proved that statement true, and I learnt the importance of teamwork and working together. More importantly, I forged meaningful and strong friendships with my newfound friends, creating lasting bonds that I deeply cherish. OBS was definitely an unforgettable experience for me.
