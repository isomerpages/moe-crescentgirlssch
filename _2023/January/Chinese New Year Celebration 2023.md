### **Chinese New Year Celebration 2023** ###

This year’s Lunar New Year Concert, the first since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, was truly an unforgettable event for all Crescentians. Much effort was put into this year's event by the performing arts groups. The Chinese and Modern Dance Society practised tirelessly for their well-choreographed and joyous performance which featured the lion and dragon dance, whilst the Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble did a fantastic job coordinating with their peers to produce a symphony of tunes.

Additionally, this year, we were extremely fortunate to have Wushu instructors from China to showcase the art of Chinese Martial Arts. Their swift movements, agile actions and fascinating flips truly amazed all staff and students. To end off their exhilarating performance was an interactive segment where a teacher and student were invited on stage to learn a set of movements. Mr Christian Seah was invited on stage for the demonstration and Sora from 4S2, was nominated by her classmates. Together they performed the different moves guided by the Wushu masters much to the delight of the audience who enthusiastically cheered them on.

The performances were extremely well received and it was evident that all Crescentians thoroughly enjoyed the myriad of spectacular performances. Finally, as an annual tradition, the Crescent Student Council gifted Mandarin oranges to the teachers and staff of the school to pass on joy, good luck and well wishes. Although this year’s Lunar New Year concert was a short one, the hall was continuously filled with booming cheers, laughter and applause throughout, a perfect way to welcome the year of the rabbit. We sincerely hope that Lunar New Year celebrations will be just as memorable and exciting in years ahead! Once again wishing one and all a Happy Lunar New Year!
