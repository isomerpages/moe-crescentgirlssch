Dedication Ceremony

The Dedication Ceremony was held to officially welcome all new students into the Crescentian family. I had initially regarded Crescent as a place of learning, nothing more, nothing less, but seeing the grand scale of this meaningful ceremony, with all levels gathered together in the hall, and my Secondary Four seniors pinning the badges on us Secondary Ones while we received heartwarming letters of encouragement, my views changed. Crescent is different.

As the Secondary Fours pinned the school badges on us Secondary Ones, it was a special moment, as it commemorated our official enrolment into the school and made us Crescentians. In that moment, I felt as if I had opened a new chapter of my life, the chapter of secondary school, of being a Crescentian.
