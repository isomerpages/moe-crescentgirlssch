### **Secondary One Orientation Campfire** ###

After a two-year hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Girl Guides is pleased to finally organise and bring the Orientation Campfire back to mark a memorable end to the Secondary One Orientation Programme.

The theme for the Orientation Campfire this year is ‘Ad Meliora - Toward Better Things!’. As the Secondary Ones join Crescent, we hope that they will always be courageous, positive, and look forward to their journey in Crescent!

As with previous years, the highlight of the campfire was the fireball drop. We were on the edge of our seats as we watched the Girl Guides Fire Department mark the start of the campfire by lighting the fireball and releasing it down a wire, from a height of four stories. Throughout the night, various CCA groups took turns to perform, displaying their different sets of skills and leaving the students in awe. The Secondary Ones also performed their respective Orientation Group (OG) cheer, adding to the lively atmosphere.

Overall, while the experience was undoubtedly challenging, seeing the smiles on the Secondary One students' faces as they enjoyed the campfire made all our efforts worthwhile.
