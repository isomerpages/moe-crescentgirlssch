## Sports Carnival ##

I walked up the flights of stairs to the entrance of the Yio Chu Kang stadium, the chatter of excited competitors and spectators becoming more and more evident as I got closer. The bustling atmosphere and hushed excitement filled the air as Crescentians in brightly coloured house t-shirts ran back and forth. Some had paint on their faces, arms and legs, while others were tying braids and finalising their house mascots and banners. It was after all, the first sports carnival after the pandemic.

After singing the national anthem, the sports carnival officially commenced. As the house leaders and teachers were setting up the first event, we were given thunder sticks to cheer for our houses and briefed on the events.

By the time the first event was about to start, the sky had started to become overcast. The once blue sky had turned into a dull grey, with muffled sounds of thunder starting to sound out from a distance. True enough, just as the first event finished, rain started to fall. As we waited for the shower to pass, music was blasted through the speakers and we sang along to the songs, followed by the mascot and banner competitions, where our house leaders dressed up as the respective mascots and held up banners representing their House.

Due to the rain, many events could not be held, and it was eventually decided that the scores of the heats be taken as the final scores.

The carnival ended with the prize presentation, with Bronte House emerging as the winning House. Even after we left the stadium, the lively atmosphere of the past few hours still lingered, the sky clearing up just in time for all of us to make our way home safely.
