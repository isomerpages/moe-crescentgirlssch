#### **National Schools Literature Festival 2023** ####

The National Schools Literature Festival took place on 15 July 2023. Held on the online platform, Zoom, this event garnered the participation of over a 100 schools in Singapore where literature students engaged in activities that were intellectually stimulating, creative and engaging. The activities conducted ranged from choral speaking to creative writing to drama and debates. Crescent Girls’ School participated in the drama and debate categories.

Hosting the Flash Fiction segment was a thrill for us, this being our first experience. Flash fiction refers to short stories that are lively, interesting and can be read on the go. The stories could be in any genre such as fantasy, science fiction, dystopian literature or horror. We were in awe at the range of ideas that the different students came up with based on the topic, ‘Hunger ‘. We were truly inspired by the writer’s voice of each individual story. The different rhetorical questions asked and the literary devices they used to evoke emotions in the reader were mind-blowing and highly applicable to our writing during English lessons. Overall, this event is one we will truly treasure and one in which we hope to participate in the future.
