### Swift Explorers Singapore ###

Swift Explorers Singapore is a series of app design and coding activities jointly organised by Crescent Girlsâ€™ School and Tinkercademy, using resources from Apple, to facilitate Primary to Junior College students in learning app design and basic coding on the iPad. Through the programme, our team was able to create our app StyleMate, which is a fashion app built to tackle indecisiveness when it comes to choosing outfits. Our big idea idea is to use an Artificial Intelligence tool that provides question prompts to which the user responds to. The AI tool will tailor the perfect outfit based on the response. StyleMate also has a donation feature which allows users to donate clothes that they no longer wear but are still in good condition. This feature helps to reduce the need to continuously purchase new clothes, thereby ensuring a more sustainable future for the fashion-conscious.

We attended a 2-day hackathon during which we built our app using Swift Playgrounds where, under the guidance of instructors from Tinkercademy, we brought our prototype to life! We also interacted with other students from other schools and saw many innovative app designs by them.

The journey was not all smooth sailing as we had issues coding our app to become 100% reflective of our keynote prototype. Despite the setback, we searched for ways to implement complicated features such as the camera function and gallery function into our app. On top of that, there were multiple instances when our code did not execute the function it was supposed to, but we resolved them. We emerged not only as more proficient coders, but also more resourceful, resilient, and patient people.

StyleMate was a success due to the mentors at Tinkercademy and most importantly, Mr Riduan. He supported and kept faith in the team and we are sincerely thankful for his support and guidance. Lastly, we would also like to thank CGS for giving us the opportunity to meet other brilliant student coders from across Singapore by organising this programme!
