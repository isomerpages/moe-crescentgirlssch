#### International Friendship Day 2023 ####

Personally, I feel that the International Friendship Day (IFD)-themed reading programme helped me to get a better idea of what IFD was and why we celebrate it each year. Initially, I used to think that it was only about learning the importance of racial harmony. However, this year, I learnt that IFD is not only about racial harmony but also about Singapore’s position in world politics and current affairs, especially in ASEAN, where Singapore is trying to establish herself as a globally recognised nation. Through the assembly programme, I learnt the importance of appreciating other cultures and traditions. Even though the main character was not Chinese, he was still able to do the Chinese pinwheel dance very well, which really goes to show that race should not be a barrier for one to do what they love. It was also interesting to see how an Indian food stall had a Chinese chef, which is not what one would usually expect. It was also a timely reminder that we should not stereotype and limit an individual based on his or her race be more open minded.<br>

What makes International Friendship Day so significant is the fact that it does not merely celebrate relationships between friends, but more importantly, friendships that span across different countries. Throughout the celebrations, I learnt that the process of forging bonds of friendships between nations is not so different from forming connections with new-found friends. One such example is what many may know as “gift-giving”. In our nation, Singapore’s, case, we have our own tradition of doing this, which is often called “orchid diplomacy”. As a symbolism of vibrancy, toughness and Singapore’s multicultural heritage, hybrid orchids are produced and gifted to visiting heads of states, a way of conveying respect and appreciation for the other nation. There are many other ways to forge and strengthen our ties of friendships between countries, but it is undeniable that doing so is extremely important. After all, it is to maintain regional stability and peace so that nations would be willing to help each other out especially in times of need.<br>
