### C.B. Paul Science Quiz ###

In Term 2, the school presented us with the opportunity to participate in the 44th C.B. Paul Science quiz organised by Anglo Chinese Junior College (ACJC) which aims to deepen studentsâ€™ interest in the Science and Mathematics. On 29th March, we first participated in the online quiz and following that, on 12th April, the eight of us headed to ACJC to attend the finals of the competition. The quiz comprised of questions from different aspects in the STEM field such as Computing, Mathematics and Science. The questions set by students of ACJC truly allowed us to think cognitively and apply the knowledge we learned in school. This opportunity presented by the school has broadened our horizons regarding the knowledge we have yet to uncover in the STEM field. While only half of us attended the final round as finalists, the rest of us cheered one another on despite not knowing each other before the competition, displaying our school spirit and support for our peers. Despite not coming in first in the final round, our school clinched third runner-up out of the many schools in Singapore, bringing glory to our school. From this experience, I learnt that I should explore information beyond the textbook as there is still much we have yet to discover. We would like to thank Mr. Lim Wee Khiang for his unwavering support in the preparation for the competition.
