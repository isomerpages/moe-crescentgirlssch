#### **National Day Celebrations**

National Day celebrations at Crescent was an eventful and memorable one. Starting the day off with a parade segment, the school stood at attention as the contingent consisting of students from the various Uniformed Groups performed their march-in. Everyone sang the National Anthem and recited the pledge with gusto, showing the united spirit of Singaporeans. The upper and lower secondary students then moved on to participate in several activities, including a dance session and visiting of food booths set up by the Parents’ Support Group in the canteen. The school then came together for a concert in the auditorium, where we were able to enjoy the wonderful performances by the Performing Arts CCAs in Crescent. The day ended off in our Crescent tradition, with the whole school singing along to ‘Home’ and forming the iconic Crescent train. Truly, the celebration is a fun-filled experience for all Crescentians to remember!  &nbsp;
