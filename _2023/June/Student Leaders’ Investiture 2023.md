### **Student Leaders’ Investiture 2023** ###

On 27th June 2023, Crescent commemorated the 10th Student Leaders’ Investiture (SLI), a momentous occasion to celebrate the accomplishments of the outgoing Secondary Four, and officially welcome newly minted student leaders. It was indeed heartening to bring back this year’s SLI programme to the hall as we celebrated the achievements of the various student leaders as a _Crescentian_ family!&nbsp;

This year's Investiture theme, "The little things: Leading from the heart" served as a meaningful reminder to all student leaders that leadership is not just about helming events, but also about displaying qualities such as gratitude, compassion and understanding so as to be a positive influence on others.&nbsp;

After an impactful speech by our Principal, Mrs Chong, the ceremony began with the presentation of key student leaders on stage to enthusiastic cheers of support. It was also memorable to watch the creative handovers of the CCA leaders and the unity of the Executive Committee members of the various student leadership groups! SLI is also an opportunity to officially welcome the probation student leaders, who were presented with their badges and whistles from their seniors as symbols of affirmation and encouragement.

SLI marks a significant milestone in every student leader’s leadership journey in Crescent, and we hope all student leaders continue to find great meaning in serving the school, leading with commitment and dedication. Together, we can keep the Crescent flag soaring high!&nbsp;
