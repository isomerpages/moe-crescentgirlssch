### Model United Nations Conference 2023 ###

Participating in the Model United Nations (MUN) conferences has been an eye-opening experience, to say the least.

Personally, one of the most striking aspects of the MUN experience is the incredible diversity of ideas generated within the council rooms. Representing different countries and advocating for their interests, delegates embody the spirit of diplomacy and cooperation, extending it beyond the council rooms to the corridors, canteens, and even socials’ night.

Engaging in heated debates, defending my delegation, and strategizing with allies was both exhilarating and challenging. The pressure I was under to articulate my thoughts effectively while countering arguments from other delegates pushed me out of my comfort zone. Along with the required extensive research, critical thinking, and the need to speak eloquently, MUN has taught me the value of preparation, adaptability, and quick thinking - skills that extend into school and personal life.

Beyond the competitive aspect, MUN enabled me to develop a profound understanding of global issues. As a Sec 2 student who has only seen the world from my little bubble, I delved into the complex realities faced by countries around the world. It opened my eyes to the intricacies of international relations and gave me a newfound awareness of the world around me.

I attended the Dunman High ASEAN Plus Summit (DHAP) during the June holidays and found it to be one of the most eye-opening experiences of 2023. As it was only my second conference, I was apprehensive and lacked confidence. However, with the support of my teachers and quick thinking, I managed to make the most of my three days in council. It taught me the importance of diplomacy and the do’s and don'ts of public speaking. I formed many friendships at DHAP and the people I formed connections with are some of the best that I know.

As much as participating in council discussions was exhilarating, MUN has also had its share of frustrations. Whether it be the intense research and speech-writing, or dealing with the stronger types of delegates, MUN sometimes left me feeling tired and exhausted. But with the motivation from friends and teachers, as well as my passion for learning about the world, I was pushed to work even harder to foster change and advocate for justice in the conference and beyond.

In conclusion, I am grateful for the friendships forged, the lessons learned, and the irreplaceable memories created during my Model United Nations journey. I am also thankful to Crescent for kickstarting my MUN interest. It has shaped my worldview and empowered me to be an agent of positive change in an increasingly interconnected and interdependent world.
