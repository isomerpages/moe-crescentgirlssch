##### Teachers’ Day Celebration #####

On 31 August 2023, Crescent held our annual Teachers’ Day celebration to acknowledge and appreciate the contributions and efforts of our teachers. This year’s theme, “Our Cornerstone”, symbolises teachers shaping students’ lives, laying the foundation upon which we build our dreams, like how a cornerstone is an essential part of a building.

For the first part of the celebration, all Crescentians and teachers gathered together at the parade square to watch performances by various CCAs and Student Leadership groups after the morning assembly, following which, the different levels of students moved to various locations including the Indoor Sports Hall, Mini forum and the Performing Arts Theatrette where the celebrations continued concurrently with live performances by the students and games.

Teachers’ Day was indeed a special day for all of us as we were able to appreciate and celebrate our teachers for all they have done for us.
**HAPPY TEACHERS’ DAY!**
