##### Champion Seminar #####

On 13 September 2023, Crescentians from all the four CCA groups came together to celebrate one another’s achievements. Crescentians were taken on a space expedition where the emcees, characterised as ‘aliens’ and ‘astronauts’, brought the audience on a journey through the different planets of the Crescent Universe to highlight the various CCA achievements in the year. Crescentians received words of encouragement from their CCA instructors and teachers and prepared heartfelt gifts for them.&nbsp;

There was also a gallery walk at the end which featured CCA montages and interviews with the teachers-in-charge. It brought much laughter and reminded us of the joys and fun CCA brought to our school life and how wonderful it was to be surrounded by like-minded individuals who put in their all to achieve greater heights as a team.&nbsp;

The occasion was aligned well to this year’s theme: *“Soar High Shooting Star”*. It highlighted how like a star, each CCA has its unique traits and with the combined effort of the team, the Crescent Universe shines brightly as it does today and in the years to come.&nbsp;
