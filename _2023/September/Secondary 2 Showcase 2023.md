### Secondary 2 Showcase

The Secondary Two Showcase, held on Friday 28 September, provided a platform for the Secondary 2 classes to showcase the events that they had gone through together over the past one and a half years in Crescent. This event was particularly exciting as it was the first time in 3 years that the Secondary 2 showcase was returning as a face-to-face event instead of being held online.&nbsp; It gave us the opportunity to work together with our classmates to present and showcase to parents our Crescentian journey. Through the ups and downs we experienced during the preparation for this event, we learned to overcome the challenges thrown at us and to look past the differences we may have had. The Secondary 2 Showcase pushed us to think out of the box to come up with unique and engaging presentations and performances. The Class Committee members who were the project managers displayed excellent leadership and did a brilliant job overseeing every single part of the event.

One of the main things that every secondary 2 student took back from this event was the memories made with their classmates. This was the highlight of the year for many of us, as it brought everyone together and strengthened the class spirit.

It indeed was a collective effort from everyone to create such a memorable event for the&nbsp;Secondary&nbsp;2&nbsp;parents and students.
