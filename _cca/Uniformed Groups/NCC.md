<h2><strong>NCC</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Crescent NC, 永远第一”</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is an enriching CCA that strives to ensure
that every cadet is not only physically fit but upholds good moral values
as we strongly believe that no matter how capable a person is they will
never be a good leader without the proper values.</p>
<p>As a Uniformed Group, we go through many training sessions where cadets
will learn how to execute foot drills, arm drills with a dummy rifle and
learn how to synchronize with their other platoonmates while doing so.
These activities require a tireless amount of effort to achieve. It is
through such training that NCC cadets bond as they go through thick and
thin together. At the same time, it instills discipline in cadets as they
learn to be more attentive, focused and respectful of the people teaching
them these drills.</p>
<p>Being NCC cadets, they experience the true joy of overcoming challenges.
Cadets often put their abilities to the test by volunteering to go through
exciting NCC courses to expand their knowledge of NCC. They are required
to attend annual camps and courses which are held at the Headquarters (HQ)
campus. Some of these courses include Camp FORGE for Secondary Ones, Camp
STEEL for Secondary Twos, Specialist Assessment for all Secondary Threes
and Senior Specialist Course for selected Secondary Three specialists.
Through these camps and courses, cadets’ emotional intelligence is put
to the test, which ensures that they are adequately prepared for further
leadership training in order to lead their unit with pride and dedication.</p>
<p>Crescent NCC members hold our core values very closely to our hearts.
A Crescent NCC cadet is always upright, committed, responsible, disciplined,
gracious and most importantly, one who genuinely cares for their fellow
cadets. At the end of one’s NCC journey, their hard work, sweat and tears
eventually pay off. One can never forget the 4 meaningful years spent with
their platoonmates, Juniors and Seniors. No one is ever forgotten in Crescent
NCC.</p>

<h3><strong>Blurbs</strong></h3>
<p>When I first joined NCC, I never expected that it would become such a
big part of my life. Although my NCC journey has been filled with challenges
and setbacks, my platoonmates always supported me through thick and thin.
This CCA has shaped me into becoming a more independent, strong and level-headed
person. I am ever so grateful for every camp, course and opportunity NCC
has given me and I can never predict what sort of experience and adventure
this CCA would offer me next. Even when HQ instructors nag at us, “Hurry
up slowly!” a phrase which I’ve learnt to interpret as “be efficient but
be careful”, is something I look forward to hearing each time I visit the
HQ. Being able to tell others that I’m from Crescent NCC and sharing our
achievements evokes a great sense of pride and gives me the motivation
to continue our legacy as a top NCC unit. I have found myself growing as
a person and I really could not ask for a more enriching CCA experience
than NCC. It truly is the foundation of my character and the most memorable
part of my Crescentian journey.&nbsp;<strong><em>– Master Sergeant Giselle Tay, Unit Sergeant Major’23/24, Delta’24, Senior Cadet Leader of NCC 2024</em></strong>

<p>NCC, a CCA I never expected to join but grew to love. That is how I would
describe my feelings towards this CCA. NCC was a part in my life that really
taught me a lot of important values, such as, discipline, time management,
hard work, resilience and much much more. NCC was a powerful platform for
my personal growth and character development. One of the life lessons I
learnt from this CCA, is “teamwork makes the dream work”. Since we were
children, we have always heard of this in storybooks, movies, animations
and more, but never did I learn the true meaning until I joined NCC. In
NCC, we go through so many experiences together, whether it be good, or
bad. We learn to support each other through the thick and thin no matter
what. Lessons learnt in NCC can continue to serve as a guiding force throughout
our life, contributing to our growth and making a positive impact on the
lives of those around us. This allows us to not only cherish our memories
but also continue to apply these valuable life lessons and skills in all
our endeavours.&nbsp;<strong><em>– Master Sergeant Subekshasri Venkateswaran, Assistant Unit Sergeant Major’23/24, Delta’24, Senior Cadet Leader of NCC 2024</em></strong>

<p>Joining NCC has been one of the best decisions that I have ever made.
It has instilled values like discipline in me while also awakening a sense
of self-motivation I had not realised I possessed. This CCA has also taught
me invaluable lessons that I will remember forever. For instance, some
camps organised by NCC HQ has put me in difficult situations where I learned
how to overcome them and better myself. During these challenges, I pushed
myself to keep going and that perseverance has developed the grit in me
greatly. Responsibility and teamwork are also some of the other important
values that I learnt. Being in NCC means being accountable for yourself
and for those around you. This sense of accountability helped me to grow
into a more responsible individual. In NCC, I have to work together closely
with different groups of people to achieve common goals. This has taught
me how to communicate with others effectively and take perspectives objectively
when working in a team. These values have all played an important role
in shaping who I am today. NCC has been a very pleasant and enriching learning
experience for me. Looking back, I would not have been able to grow into
my current self without joining NCC and I am grateful for this. NCC has
truly been the most fulfilling part of my Crescent journey that I will
never ever forget. <strong><em>– Staff Sergeant L Mridula, Unit Sergeant Major’24/25, Charlie’24, Cadet Leader of NCC 2024</em></strong>

<p>NCC, an incredibly enriching passion for all who join. Although this CCA
involves a tumultuous journey, with numerous ups and downs, hardships,
and failures, these have only made me much more stronger. The CCA instill
confidence, discipline, and resilience, all of which are essential qualities
in life. As Crescent NC strives to uphold its high standards, the CCA evokes
a powerful sense of dedication, hard work, and passion, which teaches me
to consistently give my one hundred and ten percent in all aspects of life.
As I like to put it, “Anyone who puts their heart into NCC, understands
the heart of NCC.” In simple terms, NCC requires much dedication, and only
those who are willing to adhere to it can begin to comprehend NCC’s true
meaning and purpose. Alongside character development, these challenges
allow me to forge tight-knit bonds with my platoon mates, fostering a strong
sense of belonging, as well as a place that feels like home. Additionally,
NCC offers invaluable opportunities to expand horizons and widen perspectives,
such as attending NCC HQ camps, courses, and competitions. Overall, NCC
transcends the definition of a regular CCA, and instead becomes a passion
that truly burns in me! <strong><em>– Staff Sergeant Ashlynn Tan, Assistant Unit Sergeant Major’24/25, Charlie’24, Cadet Leader of NCC 2024</em></strong>
