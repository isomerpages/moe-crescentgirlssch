<h2><strong>NCC</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Crescent NC, 永远第一”</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is an enriching CCA that strives to ensure
that every cadet is not only physically fit but upholds good moral values
as we strongly believe that no matter how capable a person is they will
never be a good leader without the proper values.</p>
<p>As a Uniformed Group, we go through many training sessions where cadets
will learn how to execute foot drills, arm drills with a dummy rifle and
learn how to synchronize with their other platoonmates while doing so.
These activities require a tireless amount of effort to achieve. It is
through such training that NCC cadets bond as they go through thick and
thin together. At the same time, it instills discipline in cadets as they
learn to be more attentive, focused and respectful of the people teaching
them these drills.</p>
<p>Being NCC cadets, they experience the true joy of overcoming challenges.
Cadets often put their abilities to the test by volunteering to go through
exciting NCC courses to expand their knowledge of NCC. They are required
to attend annual camps and courses which are held at the Headquarters (HQ)
campus. Some of these courses include Camp FORGE for Secondary Ones, Camp
STEEL for Secondary Twos, Specialist Assessment for all Secondary Threes
and Senior Specialist Course for the top 6 Secondary Three specialists.
Through these camps and courses, cadets’ emotional intelligence is put
to the test, which ensures that they are adequately prepared for further
leadership training in order to lead their unit with pride and dedication.</p>
<p>Crescent NCC members hold our core values very closely to our hearts.
A Crescent NCC cadet is always upright, committed, responsible, disciplined,
gracious and most importantly, one who genuinely cares for their fellow
cadets. At the end of one’s NCC journey, their hard work, sweat and tears
eventually pay off. One can never forget the 4 meaningful years spent with
their platoonmates, Juniors and Seniors. No one is ever forgotten in Crescent
NCC.</p>

<h3><strong>Blurbs</strong></h3>
<p>NCC took us by storm and so did the pandemic! We started our NCC journey
online due to the pandemic (in 2020) and our Specialist term started just
in time with the easing of regulations (in early 2022). The NCC had our
up and downs due to the pandemic, but by utilising our 8 core values learnt
in NCC, we successfully conquered our challenges, emerging glorious. These
challenges also shaped us into being committed and responsible leaders.
The camaraderie among the 15 of us has still left an everlasting impact
on our lives. We worked together and had fun, making memories which we
cherish dearly. Surely, Delta '23 finished strong and successful! <strong>- Delta’23, Senior Cadet Leaders of NCC 2023</strong>

<p>When I first joined NCC, I never expected that it would become such a
big part of my life. Although my NCC journey has been filled with challenges
and setbacks, my platoonmates always supported me through thick and thin.
This CCA has shaped me into becoming a more independent, strong and level-headed
person. I am ever so grateful for every camp, course and opportunity NCC
has given me and I can never predict what sort of experience and adventure
this CCA would offer me next. Even when HQ instructors nag at us, “Hurry
up slowly!” a phrase which I’ve learnt to interpret as “be efficient but
be careful”, is something I look forward to hearing each time I visit the
HQ. Being able to tell others that I’m from Crescent NCC and sharing our
achievements evokes a great sense of pride and gives me the motivation
to continue our legacy as a top NCC unit. I have found myself growing as
a person and I really could not ask for a more enriching CCA experience
than NCC. It truly is the foundation of my character and the most memorable
part of my Crescentian journey.&nbsp;<strong>– First Sergeant Giselle Tay, Unit Sergeant Major, Charlie’23, Cadet Leaders of NCC 2023</strong>

<p>NCC, a CCA I never expected to join but grew to love. That is how I would
describe my feelings towards this CCA. NCC was a part in my life that really
taught me a lot of important values, such as, discipline, time management,
hard work, resilience and much much more. NCC was a powerful platform for
my personal growth and character development. One of the life lessons I
learnt from this CCA, is “teamwork makes the dream work”. Since we were
children, we have always heard of this in storybooks, movies, animations
and more, but never did I learn the true meaning until I joined NCC. In
NCC, we go through so many experiences together, whether it be good, or
bad. We learn to support each other through the thick and thin no matter
what. Lessons learnt in NCC can continue to serve as a guiding force throughout
our life, contributing to our growth and making a positive impact on the
lives of those around us. This allows us to not only cherish our memories
but also continue to apply these valuable life lessons and skills in all
our endeavours.&nbsp;<strong>– First Sergeant Subekshasri Venkateswaran, Assistant Unit Sergeant Major, Charlie'23, Cadet Leaders of NCC 2023</strong>
