<h2><strong>NCC (Land)</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Crescent NC, 永远第一”</em>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The National Cadet Corps (NCC) is an enriching CCA that strives to ensure
that every cadet is not only physically fit but upholds good moral values
as we strongly believe that no matter how capable a person is they will
never be a good leader without the proper values.</p>
<p>As a Uniformed Group, we go through many training sessions where cadets
will learn how to execute foot drills, arm drills with a dummy rifle and
learn how to synchronize with their other platoonmates while doing so.
These activities require a tireless amount of effort to achieve. It is
through such training that NCC cadets bond as they go through thick and
thin together. At the same time, it instills discipline in cadets as they
learn to be more attentive, focused and respectful of the people teaching
them these drills.</p>
<p>Being NCC cadets, they experience the true joy of overcoming challenges.
Cadets often put their abilities to the test by volunteering to go through
exciting NCC courses to expand their knowledge of NCC. They are required
to attend annual camps and courses which are held at the Headquarters (HQ)
campus. Some of these courses include Camp FORGE for Secondary Ones, Camp
STEEL for Secondary Twos, Specialist Assessment for all Secondary Threes
and Senior Specialist Course for selected Secondary Three specialists.
Through these camps and courses, cadets’ emotional intelligence is put
to the test, which ensures that they are adequately prepared for further
leadership training in order to lead their unit with pride and dedication.</p>
<p>Crescent NCC members hold our core values very closely to our hearts.
A Crescent NCC cadet is always upright, committed, responsible, disciplined,
gracious and most importantly, one who genuinely cares for their fellow
cadets. At the end of one’s NCC journey, their hard work, sweat and tears
eventually pay off. One can never forget the 4 meaningful years spent with
their platoonmates, Juniors and Seniors. No one is ever forgotten in Crescent
NCC.</p>
