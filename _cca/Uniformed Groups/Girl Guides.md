## **GIRL GUIDES**

&gt; "WE BUILD, WE STRIKE, WE IGNITE"

Girl Guides is an all-in-one CCA with a training programme that features a range of diverse activities, from tent-pitching to art and craft that mold the Guides into versatile ladies and leaders of tomorrow.

All Guides undergo rigorous basic training, which comprises gadget-making, tent-pitching, outdoor cooking, and foot drills. This training inculcates a high level of discipline and preparedness in any situation.

Through Guiding, Guides hone numerous skills through unique experiences outside the classroom, attaining badges in the process. Proficiency badges give Guides opportunities to develop various skillsets. In attaining the Craft Badge, for instance, Guides learn to create artworks using different types of objects such as clay figurines. The World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGS) badges such as the Free Being Me badge gives Guides a chance to stop and reflect on the world around them, and the influence it has on the way they think about themselves and other people. Furthermore, Guides also attend courses such as the First Aid Course to improve themselves through learning basic first aid, which further develops a sense of responsibility they have for the people around them.

Additionally, Girl Guides regularly organise and attend campfires. Here at Crescent, one of the major campfire events is the Secondary One Orientation Campfire. During the event, each Secondary One class is coached by the Girl Guides and will showcase their camp songs, such as Peace by The River and Gako the Frog! At the campfire, the Guides will also put up an engaging performance using song and dance. There are also various performances by other CCAs keen to showcase their talents to the Secondary Ones.

A core value of Girl Guides in Crescent – “Once a Guide, Always a Guide” – anchors deeply within the hearts of all Guides. We firmly believe that a Girl Guide will always be part of the guiding family, even after graduation, and every senior will be welcomed back with open arms. Another motto of ours – “Be prepared” – instils a culture of readiness to tackle any obstacle or challenge by being observant and vigilant at all times.

The first week of my school was a different and unique experience and I had a lot of doubts as I was settling into a new school. I only had a few friends and wanted to make more friends. The day of the campfire was very fun and enjoyable with me bonding with my classmates and making new friends with our shared interest in guides and how wonderful the campfire was. We quickly bonded and decided to put guides as our CCA option hopefully getting in together and we did. We were so happy and could not wait to make memories together and from then we have not just been friends in school but also outside - **Sivakumar Reshmi (1S1), Patrol Member of Flowerpecker, her feelings of joining Girl Guides**

Outdoor cooking is a fun experience that I look forward to in Girl Guides. We learn important skills such as how to start a fire and how to cook basic meals. Unlike OBS outdoor cooking, we do not need to rely on solid fuel to start a fire and instead can start one just using twigs and a match! Other than the skills in fire-starting and basic cooking, outdoor cooking has also taught me resilience, patience, and teamwork. Outdoor cooking is overall a memorable and enriching experience that I enjoy - **Olivia Fu Huizhen (2S1), Patrol Member of Bougainvillea, on the skills and values she has learnt from the various Girl Guides activities thus far.**

"Once in a Lifetime Experience" - that is how I would describe my entire process of acquiring the Baden Powell Award. It all began with planning programs in which we included activities that we would like to carry out, helping me develop my program planning skills. Once we passed that round, we had to conduct the activities we had planned for other guides from other schools via Zoom. During the session, despite facing several technical difficulties that tested my resolve, I persevered toward my end goal - conducting a meaningful session for the guides. The joy of guiding my fellow Guides through the session gave me a sense of fulfilment.

The road to the Baden Powell Award demanded dedication and perseverance. The remarkable experience left me with unforgettable memories. The Baden Powell Award is more than an accolade; it is a testament to the incredible growth and empowerment that can be found within the heart of a devoted Guide." - **A Musfira Najiya (3C1), Patrol leader of Orchid, achieving** **The Baden Powell Award (BPA), the highest award given out by our Chief Commissioner to a Girl Guide**

Over the past 3 years in Girl Guides, I have taken part in many headquarters organised events. One of the most memorable events I had taken part in was the Free Being Me workshop where I learned more about image myth and its impacts on a person and society. I found this extremely meaningful since I realised that as a teenager I always cared about my looks and how I presented myself. Through this workshop, I changed my mind to thinking that I should be myself and that society should accept me for who I am and how I look. Hence, through these workshops, I have learned more about myself and issues in society, gaining more knowledge through Girl Guides – **P Haritha Sree (3G3), Assistant Company Leader of Girl Guides Company 2 2023/2024, on her experience in girl guides after 3 years.**
