<h2><strong>GIRL GUIDES</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"WE BUILD, WE STRIKE, WE IGNITE"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Girl Guides is an all-in-one CCA with a training programme that features
a range of diverse activities, from tent-pitching to art and craft that
mold the Guides into versatile ladies and leaders of tomorrow.</p>
<p>All Guides undergo rigorous basic training, which comprises gadget-making,
tent-pitching, outdoor cooking, and foot drills. This training inculcates
a high level of discipline and preparedness in any situation.</p>
<p>Through Guiding, Guides hone numerous skills through unique experiences
outside the classroom, attaining badges in the process. Proficiency badges
give Guides opportunities to develop various skillsets. In attaining the
Craft Badge, for instance, Guides learn to create artworks using different
types of objects such as clay figurines. The World Association of Girl
Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGS) badges such as the Free Being Me badge gives
Guides a chance to stop and reflect on the world around them, and the influence
it has on the way they think about themselves and other people. Furthermore,
Guides also attend courses such as the First Aid Course to improve themselves
through learning basic first aid, which further develops a sense of responsibility
they have for the people around them.</p>
<p>Additionally, Girl Guides regularly organise and attend campfires. Here
at Crescent, one of the major campfire events is the Secondary One Orientation
Campfire. During the event, each Secondary One class is coached by the
Girl Guides and will showcase their camp songs, such as Peace by The River
and Gako the Frog! At the campfire, the Guides will also put up an engaging
performance using song and dance. There are also various performances by
other CCAs keen to showcase their talents to the Secondary Ones.</p>
<p>A core value of Girl Guides in Crescent – “Once a Guide, Always a Guide”
– anchors deeply within the hearts of all Guides. We firmly believe that
a Girl Guide will always be part of the guiding family, even after graduation,
and every senior will be welcomed back with open arms. Another motto of
ours – “Be prepared” – instils a culture of readiness to tackle any obstacle
or challenge by being observant and vigilant at all times.</p>
