<h2><strong>GIRL GUIDES</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"WE BUILD, WE STRIKE, WE IGNITE"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Girl Guides is an all-in-one CCA with a training programme that features
a range of diverse activities, from tent-pitching to art and craft that
mold the Guides into versatile ladies and leaders of tomorrow.</p>
<p>All Guides undergo rigorous basic training, which comprises gadget-making,
tent-pitching, outdoor cooking, and foot drills. This training inculcates
a high level of discipline and preparedness in any situation.</p>
<p>Through Guiding, Guides hone numerous skills through unique experiences
outside the classroom, attaining badges in the process. Proficiency badges
give Guides opportunities to develop various skillsets. In attaining the
Craft Badge, for instance, Guides learn to create artworks using different
types of objects such as clay figurines. The World Association of Girl
Guides and Girl Scouts (WAGGS) badges such as the Free Being Me badge gives
Guides a chance to stop and reflect on the world around them, and the influence
it has on the way they think about themselves and other people. Furthermore,
Guides also attend courses such as the First Aid Course to improve themselves
through learning basic first aid, which further develops a sense of responsibility
they have for the people around them.</p>
<p>Additionally, Girl Guides regularly organise and attend campfires. Here
at Crescent, one of the major campfire events is the Secondary One Orientation
Campfire. During the event, each Secondary One class is coached by the
Girl Guides and will showcase their camp songs, such as Peace by The River
and Gako the Frog! At the campfire, the Guides will also put up an engaging
performance using song and dance. There are also various performances by
other CCAs keen to showcase their talents to the Secondary Ones.</p>
<p>A core value of Girl Guides in Crescent – “Once a Guide, Always a Guide”
– anchors deeply within the hearts of all Guides. We firmly believe that
a Girl Guide will always be part of the guiding family, even after graduation,
and every senior will be welcomed back with open arms. Another motto of
ours – “Be prepared” – instils a culture of readiness to tackle any obstacle
or challenge by being observant and vigilant at all times.</p>

<p>Outdoor cooking is a fun experience that I look forward to in Girl Guides.
We learn important skills such as how to start a fire and how to cook basic
meals. Unlike OBS outdoor cooking, we do not need to rely on solid fuel
to start a fire and instead can start one just using twigs and a match!
Other than the skills in fire-starting and basic cooking, outdoor cooking
has also taught me resilience, patience, and teamwork. Outdoor cooking
is overall a memorable and enriching experience that I enjoy - <strong>Olivia Fu Huizhen (3G4), Patrol Member of Bougainvillea, on the skills and values she has learnt from the various Girl Guides activities thus far.</strong>

<p>"Once in a Lifetime Experience" - that is how I would describe my entire
process of acquiring the Baden Powell Award. It all began with planning
programs in which we included activities that we would like to carry out,
helping me develop my program planning skills. Once we passed that round,
we had to conduct the activities we had planned for other guides from other
schools via Zoom. During the session, despite facing several technical
difficulties that tested my resolve, I persevered toward my end goal -
conducting a meaningful session for the guides. The joy of guiding my fellow
Guides through the session gave me a sense of fulfilment.</p>
<p>The road to the Baden Powell Award demanded dedication and perseverance.
The remarkable experience left me with unforgettable memories. The Baden
Powell Award is more than an accolade; it is a testament to the incredible
growth and empowerment that can be found within the heart of a devoted
Guide." - <strong>A Musfira Najiya (4C1), Patrol leader of Orchid, achieving</strong>  <strong>The Baden Powell Award (BPA), the highest award given out by our Chief Commissioner to a Girl Guide</strong>

<p>Over the past 3 years in Girl Guides, I have taken part in many headquarters
organised events. One of the most memorable events I had taken part in
was the Free Being Me workshop where I learned more about image myth and
its impacts on a person and society. I found this extremely meaningful
since I realised that as a teenager I always cared about my looks and how
I presented myself. Through this workshop, I changed my mind to thinking
that I should be myself and that society should accept me for who I am
and how I look. Hence, through these workshops, I have learned more about
myself and issues in society, gaining more knowledge through Girl Guides
