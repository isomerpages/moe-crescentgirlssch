<h2><strong>RED CROSS YOUTH</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"United As One, We Stand Strong!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Red Cross Youth is one of the three Uniformed Groups in Crescent Girls’
School. As a Uniformed Group, we instill the values of self-discipline,
order and teamwork in our cadets. Contrary to popular belief that Red Cross
Youth only teach First Aid, we also expose our cadets to activities and
lessons such as Disaster Management, Foot-Drill and Red Cross Knowledge
Our cadets are also exposed to various activities at Red Cross Headquarters
such as National First Aid Championship and Gold Modular workshop</p>
<p>The Red Cross Youth is a humanitarian-based Co-Curricular Activity (CCA)
that nurtures values such as compassion, service, and resilience. In line
with the spirit of the Red Cross, our unit is actively involved in a community
involvement programme through visits to the Red Cross Home for the Disabled.
During these visits, our cadets engage meaningfully with the residents
through conversations and simple activities, while also contributing to
the upkeep of the home through area cleaning tasks. In addition, our members
take part in a CCA mentoring initiative with students from Blangah Rise
Primary School, further developing their leadership and interpersonal skills.</p>
<p>Our cadets are also exposed to real-life situations and are made to put
their skills learned in Red Cross to use. They are deployed for First Aid
duty during school events such as Sports Carnival and Cross Country. A
more frequent duty would be during our weekly FITT runs. Our cadets will
be stationed along the FITT run routes so as to ensure that the injured
students will be tended to as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The motto of Red Cross Youth is&nbsp;<strong><em>“Humanity in Our Hands”</em></strong>.
Our main objective is to help one another as well as the community. As
cadets, we work together as a team. Everyone plays a vital part in the
work that we do. We cannot afford to be complacent, as we are taught to
be always ready in the event that life may be in danger and to have a sense
of urgency.</p>
