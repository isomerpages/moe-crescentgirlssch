## **RED CROSS YOUTH** ##

&gt; "United As One, We Stand Strong!"

Red Cross Youth is one of the three Uniformed Groups in Crescent Girls’ School. As a Uniformed Group, we instill the values of self-discipline, order and teamwork in our cadets. Contrary to popular belief that Red Cross Youth only teaches First Aid, we also expose our cadets to activities and lessons such as Disaster Management, Foot-Drill and Red Cross Knowledge Our cadets are also exposed to various activities at Red Cross Headquarters and competitions such as Annual Red Cross Flag Day &amp; National First Aid Competition.  

Red Cross is a humanitarian organization. Thus, as a Co-Curricular Activity, we are often involved in community involvement programs, such as&nbsp; Red Cross Flag Day and Home visits. During home visits, we interact with residents and as well as get hands-on doing area cleaning for the home.  

Our cadets are also exposed to real-life situations and are made to put their skills learned in Red Cross to use. They are deployed for First Aid duty during school events such as Sports Day and Cross Country. A more frequent duty would be during our weekly FITT runs. Our cadets will be stationed along the FITT run routes so as to ensure that the injured students will be tended to as soon as possible.  

The motto of Red Cross Youth is ***"The motto of Red Cross Youth is “Humanity in Our Hands”***. Our main objective is to help one another as well as the community. As cadets, we work together as a team. Everyone plays a vital part in the work that we do. We cannot afford to be complacent, as we are taught to be always ready in the event that life may be in danger and to have a sense of urgency.

Being in Red Cross Youth taught me the core skills of discipline and to look out for others. This is because I not only looked out for people who needed help, but I also looked out for my squadmates as we worked together through challenges to learn many life skills. ***- Shirin Angeline, 2G2***

I started my Red Cross Youth (RCY) journey in 2021, and it continues to be the most enriching experience of my life. RCY, being a uniformed group, also ingrained a sense of discipline in me, which I can put to good use in other aspects of my life. I was able to develop a growth mindset and learn how to take feedback positively. I also learned how to communicate more maturely and effectively. ***- Loh En Tong, 3C2***

Throughout the years from being a cadet to becoming an NCO, I learnt what it meant to be disciplined yet still have fun during CCA. Being disciplined enabled us to grow not only in the CCA but also to become better individuals who consistently worked hard by putting in effort in everything we do. ***- Shamitrra Aruchunan, 3G1***

During my time with Red Cross Youth (RCY), a humanitarian organization dedicated to making a positive difference in communities, I engaged in various initiatives and projects, including doing First Aid Duty during FITT run, contributing to the Grateful Hearts Campaign, as well as planning for the many fun and enriching activities in Crescent RCY.&nbsp;My journey with RCY has been a transformative one, fostering a deep sense of empathy, responsibility, and a commitment to serve humanity. ***- Lydia Sun Liya, 4C1***
