## **CREZCOMM LEADERS** ##

> "Leading hand in hand, heart to heart"

The CrezCommunity leaders at Crescent Girls’ School play a significant role in promoting a sense of belonging to the Crescent community and to Singapore, through fostering positive relations and by spreading joy to students and staff. In their journey as leaders, the CrezCommunity Leaders aim to cultivate positive emotions for all and to make a difference in the lives of others in the school community. They organise and run meaningful school wide events such as the Crescent Care Programme, Total Defence Day and National Day where they try to inject enriching and educational elements into these events while making it as fun an event as possible for the study body.

If there was a simple way to describe CrezCommunity, I would say it has “positive vibes”. Every meeting I attend radiates liveliness and joy; everyone is supportive and encouraging.

As a Secondary Two CrezCommunity leader with less than a year of experience, I’m grateful to be able to partake in a lot of activities and contribute to the school. I was given the opportunity to help in events such as Total Defence Day as well as play a part in the success of large-scale celebrations like National Day, a refreshing experience in seeing the behind the scenes of the concerts we so often take for granted. Being part of the CrezCommunity family ensures that we are reflective and empathetic role models for our peers. Being a CrezCommunity leader has truly made me more understanding and proactive in contributing to the school. ***- Arianne Teow Si Jia (2C2), Secondary Two CrezCommunity Leader***

Being a CrezCommunity leader has taught me how to plan events and how to work well with others. Through the many activities that we plan in CrezCommunity, I had the opportunity to work with more people whether they were my batch mates or my juniors. This has taught me about working as a team and communicate effectively with others. Amidst planning events, memories are created as we bond while working together. When I first joined CrezCommunity, I remember only interacting familiar faces, and rarely with those I was not close to. But after being grouped up with those less familiar to me, I had the opportunity to interact with new people which made me more comfortable in expressing myself. I feel that CrezCommunity is a platform for me to share my ideas as my CrezCommunity Leaders are always open to hearing new ideas. This has made me enjoy my time in CrezCommunity and has taught me invaluable skills. ***- Chua Yun En Chloe (3G2), Secondary Three CrezCommunity Leader***

CrezCommunity has helped me meet many people of different personalities and has encouraged me to step out of my comfort zone, making me more outspoken and confident.  I have learnt many things from working in CrezCommunity, such as the importance of being a compassionate collaborator. When presenting to the secondary One class during Crescent Care Programme, I learned the skill of speaking to groups of people, which has been useful in other aspects like school projects or speaking in general. I have also learnt the importance of having a drive for excellence. When leading the planning for the National Day Concert, one difficult aspect was the planning of role allocations during the concert. It was hard to think about the tasks needed to be done, while coordinating when the CrezCommunity leaders were free, and communicating the tasks to the CrezCommunity leaders. With the help of my team members, we were able to do it and the concert went smoothly! ***- Wong En-Xi (3S2), Secondary Three President of CrezCommunity Leaders***
