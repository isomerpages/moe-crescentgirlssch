## **STUDENT COUNCIL**
&gt; “AMBASSADORS OF CRESCENTIAN IDENTITY”

Crescent’s Student Council is a student-led organisation whose mission is to nurture passionate and kind lady leaders who possess a forward-looking and positive mindset. Acting as the bridge between the student body and the school leaders, our Student Councillors are driven to serve the student body with passion, dedication and commitment. Through this, they develop the heart to serve and guide others, and strive to display the five pillars of servant leadership, PERMAH domains, and our council values Modesty, Integrity and Courage (MIC) under any circumstance.

As ladies and leaders of tomorrow, the Student Council believes in serving with dedication, commitment and love to ensure the well-being of our community. Being the bridge of communication for the student body to the teachers and school leaders, Student Councillors actively reach out to their peers to hear their concerns through platforms like the Student Leaders’ Forum as well as informal feedback settings within their classrooms, or when mingling with schoolmates. After receiving these responses, appropriate actions will be taken so as to address the issues raised, as Student Councillors are constantly seeking to work with the teachers in improving the Crescent experience.

Crescent’s Student Councillors take on a kaleidoscope of dynamic roles in the varied job scope they fulfil. Through their various departments, they extend their service as servant leaders to provide support and serve the school holistically. Along with their fundamental role to uphold school discipline standards through administrative duties like spot-check, class cleanliness and latecoming reporting, they also lead the school community through leadership nurturing activities for others and themselves. They are also actively involved in organising school-wide events such as the Student Leaders Investiture and Teachers’ Day Celebration.&nbsp;Such planning and organising fuel our their creativity, providing them with the learning experience of being able to plan more independently and to take intiative.

Leadership training goes beyond workshops held for them, but it also extends to them attending peer teaching sessions on lessons about leadership from the book: “Habitudes: Images that form Leadership Habits &amp; Attitudes” by Dr Tim Alore. These trainings and workshops allow our Student Councillors to be equipped with the heart of a servant leader and better demonstrate the 5 leadership pillars in their everyday service to the school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

All in all, the Student Council provides a wide range of activities to groom our Student Councillors into leaders of the future – leaders anchored with a heart of service.

Council has provided me with an enriching experience of growing as a leader to serve the larger Crescentian community and beyond. It is through Council that I have learned that leadership is an ever-evolving process of constantly bettering oneself through putting in effort to grow ourselves. Before joining Council, I was constantly apprehensive of having to work in a team with others, but after having worked with so many wonderful batchmates and seniors during the planning of events such as Investiture and Teachers’ Day, I can see how I have grown to be an effective and contributing member of a team, creatively synergising to achieve a common target. Council is a safe environment to make mistakes and learn from them, guided by seniors and batchmates who got your back through it all. ***- Chiam Chieh Leng Vanessa (4C2), Secondary 4 EXCO***

Being a part of the student council has been a meaningful and enriching experience for me. The lessons, experiences, and values I have learnt have taught me the importance of servant leadership and many core values such as resilience, teamwork and innovativeness. Student Council has also taught me the importance of good time management, as I had to plan my time to be able to manage event planning tasks as well as my academics and other commitments to the best of my ability. Student Council has shaped me into a better servant leader, and has taught me that being a leader is more than just a position. In conclusion, the time I have spent in council has been a very valuable experience and has shaped me into a better version of myself.

Student Council has provided me with many opportunities to grow and learn as a person. Being in Student Council has allowed me to take on different roles in event planning and this has enabled me to become a well-rounded student in Crescent. One important thing that I have learnt since starting as a councillor in Secondary Two is the importance of communicating effectively with others, as well as being able to lead and step back at appropriate times. I really enjoy being a part of the Student Council community as everyone is very welcoming and understanding. Through Student Council, I am able to become a better version of myself.
***- Shanice Ng (3G2), Sec 3 Vice President***


My journey in Student Council so far has been filled with opportunities for growth and self-discovery. Through events and lessons intended to both engage the mind and instill the skills of servant leadership, not only have I begun to imbibe core values such as empathy and resilience, but I have also garnered an array of life skills — chief among them, the art of effective communication. Council fosters an environment where encouragement flows freely, and as we progress in honing our intra-personal skills, I can step forward with a peace of mind, knowing that my batchmates, seniors, and teachers are there to support and guide me every step along the way.

Reflecting on the hours poured in by my fellow councillors and me, I realised that these moments have crystallised into one of my most treasured memories in Crescent, and it is these experiences that made me understand that servant leadership transcends beyond a static position; it is about helping others and embodying a set of principles that illuminate every action. As this chapter in my Crescent journey unfolds, I hope to carry with me the invaluable memories and lessons learned along the way, and to be able to look back one day with a sense of gratitude for the opportunities I have had and the support I have received.
