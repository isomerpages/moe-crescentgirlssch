## **HOUSE LEADERS**

&gt; “5 COLOURS, 1 CRESCENT FAMILY”

The Crescent House system consists of five different houses, namely Bronte, Curie, Fry, Keller and Pankhurst. The five houses participate in the annual Crescent House Challenge, competing in various competitions to accumulate points. It was designed to unite the houses in a competitive yet fun and engaging way, taking advantage of athletic and artistic components to enhance cohesion. It nurtures the students’ potential, ultimately bringing about a harmonious realm of school spirit. The house which earns the most points throughout the course of the year is awarded the title of ‘CHAMPION HOUSE’ for its efforts.

The Crescent House organises not only sporting events such as the biennial Cross Country and Sports Carnival but also other events such as Champion Seminar, an event in which House takes great pride. It serves to congratulate and recognise students' efforts in bringing glory to the school.

To most Crescentians, House is the school spirit. Tuesday mornings at the Alexandra Canal are never quiet with the loud, booming voices of House Leaders constantly encouraging and cheering their schoolmates on during the weekly FITT Runs. Of course, we can’t forget FITT aerobics, which is also very much loved by the Crescentians as they sing along to the latest hits while exercising.

We are also easily identified by the brightly coloured house shirts each of the five houses, Bronte, Curie, Fry, Keller and last but not least, Pankhurst. Each of these houses is named after inspirational women who have made a difference in this world; Bronte, named after The Bronte Sisters, Curie, after Marie Curie, Fry after Elizabeth Fry, Keller named after Helen Keller and Pankhurst named after Emmeline Pankhurst. Naming each house after motivational women serves as an inspiration to all Crescentians, encouraging them to follow in their footsteps to become our very own influential Ladies and Leaders of tomorrow.

“Ever since I joined House, I have been able to experience things that I never thought I would have in my secondary school life. From organizing school-wide events like Inter-House Games, Champion Seminar, to cheering on my schoolmates in National School Games matches, I am proud to say that my journey in House has been nothing short of rewarding. My house mates have truly become a part of my family, and if I could go back, I would do it all over again!” ***– Aydan Lee Ya Han (3G3), BRONTE House Captain***

“After Joining House, it pushed me out of my comfort zone, and gave me many opportunities to take the lead. It also has given me valuable experience in planning school-wide events, such as Sports Carnival or Champion Seminar. We always strive for excellence and put in 110% effort into the things we produce. Furthermore, my batchmates are like a second family to me, and I couldn’t have done it without them. It is truly a fruitful experience and worth all the effort we have put in!” ***– Lo Yi Ting (3G3), KELLER House Captain***

As a House Leader, we help prepare things for events such as for Champion Seminar, Inter-House games, Sports Carnival, and many more. After joining house, I feel so much more bonded with my friends from my own, and other cohorts and houses. Despite difficulties, we always push through, making sure we reach our end goal which makes all of us more tenacious. I have become more enthusiastic, driven, responsible, and have had a great time in house!” ***– Leah Sasayiah (2S2) FRY House Leader***

“Being a House leader has taught me patience and confidence. It has taught me that even the smallest things can make the biggest impact. It has made me someone who enjoys spreading positivity to others. Joining house has also made me more bonded with my House-mates who aren’t in my class. We have made boards for Champion Seminar which has me proud of all the effort we put in. I’m thankful for this opportunity to become a House Leader.” ***- Siti NurDafiyah Chee Binti Daanyal Chee(2G2) PANKHURST House Leader***

“House is not just a leadership group. It’s somewhere where unforgettable friendships are formed and something I would always look forward to at the end of the week. It has taught me resilience, empathy, and kindness towards others. Every house session is not only filled with hard work, but lots of laughter and joy as well. Never have I once regretted putting House as my first choice!”  ***- Mridini Amberkhane, CURIE House Aesthetics Rep (3S2)***
