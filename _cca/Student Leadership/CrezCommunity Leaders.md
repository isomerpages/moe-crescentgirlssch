<h2><strong>CREZCOMMUNITY LEADERS</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Leading hand in hand, heart to heart"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The CrezCommunity leaders at Crescent Girls’ School play a significant
role in promoting a sense of belonging to the Crescent community and to
Singapore, through fostering positive relations and by spreading joy to
students and staff. In their journey as leaders, the CrezCommunity Leaders
aim to cultivate positive emotions for all and to make a difference in
the lives of others in the school community. They organise and run meaningful
school-wide events such as the Crescent Care Programme, Total Defence Day
and National Day where they try to inject enriching and educational elements
into these events while making it as fun an event as possible for the study
body.</p>

<p>Through the two years of me being a Crezcommunity leader, not only have
I learnt the values a leader should possess but also gained invaluable
memories with friends. Through planning and executing programmes such as
National Day and Exam Welfare Packs, I have developed the skills to help
lead and support my school. While planning these activities, I learnt how
to effectively communicate and express my ideas while making sure everybody’s
needs and desires are met. Being a leader can sometimes be challenging,
however, with the help of all the supportive and understanding CrezCommunity
leaders, I find myself growing and learning more about being a lady and
leader of tomorrow. The friends and experiences I have made through CrezComm
have truly been one of a kind and I can’t wait to make more. Through each
Crezcomm meeting, I forge stronger bonds with my schoolmates, contributing
to the effectiveness of our ideas and cohesion as a leadership group. While
there have been up and downs, the support of the teachers and the crezcomm
team, make every problem easily rectified and helps us grow stronger as
a team. This is my journey and experience so far in CrezCommunity, it has
cultivated me to grow into an empathetic servant leader. <strong><em>- Yew Yores 2G2</em></strong>

<p>CrezCommunity is an exciting journey of leadership development and service
to theschool. Personally, it has pushed me to not just be a leader who
simply listens to others’ feedback, but a leader who takes action to address
others’ feedback. Through carrying out meeting sessions and planning projects
like Exam Welfare Packs and National Day, I have learnt to be one step
ahead in thinking about the interests and needs of others and make preparations
for it — whether it is changing my communication style or sharing suitable
resources. Initially, I struggled to proactively put myself in the shoes
of the students and my fellow CrezCommunity leaders, but CrezCommunity
provided me with many opportunities to try and try again, helping me to
refine my leadership skills and become an even more competent and thoughtful
leader. With many other encouraging leaders by my side, too, my journey
is not a solo one as we learn from each other’s strengths and help to improve
each other’s weaknesses. In CrezCommunity, we grow as compassionate and
confident leaders together! <strong><em>- Arianne Teow Sijia 3C2</em></strong>

<p>Stepping into the role of a CrezCommunity leader has been a transformative
and rewarding journey. Although I did not have much experience, I’ve had
the opportunity to plan and organise events like Total Defence Day and
National Day with different people. This has pushed me to think outside
of the box, learn to work collaboratively with others, and step outside
of my comfort zone. Additionally, I was able to bond well with many people,
learn more about them, and forge new friendships. Being part of the CrezCommunity
family has also played a part in my growth as a leader as their support
and encouragement made me feel more confident and willing to embrace new
ideas and responsibilities. Each and every experience has taught me the
importance of collaboration and compassion, allowing me to grow both as
a leader, and as a person. <strong><em>- Khoo Yu Han Cheryl 2C2</em></strong>
