<h2><strong>Digital Art and Photography Club (DAPC)</strong></h2>
<p>Crescent’s Digital Art and Photography Club (DAPC) aims to cultivate students’
interests, confidence and expertise in using both photography and art as
mediums to communicate thoughts, feelings, and positive messages. Activities
conducted during CCA sessions are geared towards developing the students’
technical skills as well as soft skills such as teamwork, project management,
communication, discipline, and a keen appreciation for beauty.</p>
<p>Students are also given various opportunities to showcase their skills
in national competitions throughout the year such as Our School Our Stories,
#ClickArt, and the Live On Festival. They are also crucial in helping to
capture beautiful memories during school events such as concerts and sporting
events.</p>
<p>Students will go through a basic photography course when they join the
CCA. This course will equip them with the necessary skills to handle the
camera and the various composition techniques. After this course, students
will continue to develop their skills through an intermediate documentary
photography course in which they will also enhance their photo-editing
techniques.</p>
<p>For digital art, students will be given the opportunity to use different
types of software such as Adobe Lightroom, Reality Composer, Snapseed,
and Procreate to bring their ideas to life – be it through digital design
and animation or the creation of objects in augmented reality. Our DAPC
students have also participated in the Singapore Youth Festival Art Exhibition
in 2024. Their creative artworks have been featured in the SYF Art Exhibition
Showcase and Catalogue this year.</p>
