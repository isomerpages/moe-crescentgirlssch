<h2><strong>INFOCOMM TECHNOLOGY CLUB</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"SHIFT THE CONTROL TO US AND WE WILL ALTER THE WORLD"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2023, the Infocomm Club embarked on several exciting initiatives that
showcased its diverse talents and expertise, with the two main ones being
robotics and Swift programming.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of dedicated teachers and instructors, the club members
were trained in robotics. Through hands-on workshops and training sessions,
students have gained insights into the building and the programming of
the EV3 bots.</p>
<p>The club was also introduced to Swift programming, a language that is
used to create applications for Apple devices. Our members had the opportunity
to explore app development and honed their skills in designing and coding.
This initiative not only equipped students with valuable programming skills
but also exposed them to mobile application development which would be
very useful in tech related occupations.</p>
<p>The Infocomm Club takes pride in its active participation in various competitions
that challenge students to showcase their technical abilities. This year,
some of the club members enthusiastically participated in the National
Youth Tech Championship (NYTC), a competition held by IMDA Singapore and
Google. This competition encouraged teamwork, problem-solving skills, and
creativity. It also tested our spontaneous thinking. We were also introduced
to drones in this event, and we learned how to manoeuvre it using coding
in Python language.</p>
<p>The culmination of the club’s efforts was evident in its participation
in the National Robotics Competition (NRC). The club fielded a team that
designed, built, and programmed a robot to overcome intricate challenges,
demonstrating both technical competence and innovative problem-solving
skills. Through these different competitions and workshops, we have learned
many things like teamwork, leadership, presentation skills, team spirit,
and various tech-related skills.</p>
<p>The Infocomm Club remains aligned with the school's vision and values,
actively being innovative, strive for excellence, and demonstrating good
teamwork. Through various projects, workshops, and outreach programs, the
club aims to make a positive impact on the school community and beyond.
The members have been involved in tech-related workshops for fellow students
and the public, contributing to digital literacy and fostering a culture
of innovation within the school. We have participated in Values-in-Action
(ViA) projects like teaching primary school kids on app development at
the Choa Chu Kang Library.</p>
<p>On top of workshops and competitions, members also attend leadership conferences
hosted by IMDA Singapore which develop in them valuable leadership skills
on how to manage a team or CCA effectively.</p>
<p>The teachers in charge: Ms Azilah, Mr Kelwin Koh, and Ms Fadilah, have
been constantly guiding us through these competitions and workshops. They
have been a constant support to us and have always encouraged us. Their
unwavering support has been vital in nurturing the club's members into
competent and confident leaders in tech.</p>

<h3><strong>Blurbs</strong></h3>
<p>“Infocomm Club has given me various opportunities to express my interests
as well as improve on my weaknesses regarding technology and computing.
The environment at Infocomm Club is extremely friendly and welcoming, which
helps me to be at ease when participating in club activities.” <strong><em>– Charlotte Ye Xiaoxian (2C2)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>“I enjoy Infocomm a lot as it helps me learn skills that are beneficial
for the future while being in a comfortable environment. It has an environment
that makes me feel like I can ask any question and not be judged. The teachers
are always so understanding and patient, making me feel even more like
I belong.” <strong><em>– Yeo Kee Yam Shanice (Yang Qian) (3G3)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>“The workshops that I have attended during CCA has helped expanded my
knowledge in terms of technology. I enjoy delving deeper into topics I
cannot learn during regular lessons in school, such as the Artificial Intelligence
technology as well as game development. Learning about such topics has
increased my interest in technology and is an “eye-opener” to the advancing
world we live in. I am always excited what our CCA has in store.” <strong><em>- Joanne Chong Yong En (3S1)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>“I absolutely love being a part of the Infocomm Club for many reasons.
One of the most exciting aspects of being in the club is the opportunity
for hands-on learning and experimentation. I get to explore many technologies,
try out new software, and tinker with hardware components. This practical
experience not only enhances my tech-related skills but also fuels my curiosity
and creativity. Moreover, Infocomm club serves as a platform for leadership
opportunities. I had the chance to take on a leadership role, attend different
leadership conferences, and hone my communication and teamwork skills.
These experiences are invaluable for my future career and personal life.
Last but not least, the club provides me with a sense of belonging and
a community of like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology.
Infocomm Club has been a place where I can thrive, pursue my passions,
and build lasting connections with fellow tech enthusiasts.” <strong><em>-Alagappan Visalakshi (3G3)</em></strong>
