<h2><strong>INFOCOMM TECHNOLOGY CLUB</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"SHIFT THE CONTROL TO US AND WE WILL ALTER THE WORLD"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2023, the Infocomm Club embarked on several exciting initiatives that
showcased its diverse talents and expertise, with the two main ones being
robotics and Swift programming.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of dedicated teachers and instructors, the club members
were trained in robotics. Through hands-on workshops and training sessions,
students have gained insights into the building and the programming of
the EV3 bots.</p>
<p>The club was also introduced to Swift programming, a language that is
used to create applications for Apple devices. Our members had the opportunity
to explore app development and honed their skills in designing and coding.
This initiative not only equipped students with valuable programming skills
but also exposed them to mobile application development which would be
very useful in tech related occupations.</p>
<p>The Infocomm Club takes pride in its active participation in various competitions
that challenge students to showcase their technical abilities. This year,
some of the club members enthusiastically participated in the National
Youth Tech Championship (NYTC), a competition held by IMDA Singapore and
Google. This competition encouraged teamwork, problem-solving skills, and
creativity. It also tested our spontaneous thinking. We were also introduced
to drones in this event, and we learned how to manoeuvre it using coding
in Python language.</p>
<p>The culmination of the club’s efforts was evident in its participation
in the National Robotics Competition (NRC). The club fielded a team that
designed, built, and programmed a robot to overcome intricate challenges,
demonstrating both technical competence and innovative problem-solving
skills. Through these different competitions and workshops, we have learned
many things like teamwork, leadership, presentation skills, team spirit,
and various tech-related skills.</p>
<p>The Infocomm Club remains aligned with the school's vision and values,
actively being innovative, strive for excellence, and demonstrating good
teamwork. Through various projects, workshops, and outreach programs, the
club aims to make a positive impact on the school community and beyond.
The members have been involved in tech-related workshops for fellow students
and the public, contributing to digital literacy and fostering a culture
of innovation within the school. We have participated in Values-in-Action
(ViA) projects like teaching primary school kids on app development at
the Choa Chu Kang Library.</p>
<p>On top of workshops and competitions, members also attend leadership conferences
hosted by IMDA Singapore which develop in them valuable leadership skills
on how to manage a team or CCA effectively.</p>
<p>The teachers in charge: Ms Azilah, Mr Kelwin Koh, and Ms Fadilah, have
been constantly guiding us through these competitions and workshops. They
have been a constant support to us and have always encouraged us. Their
unwavering support has been vital in nurturing the club's members into
competent and confident leaders in tech.</p>
