<h2>AUDIO VISUAL AID (AVA) CLUB</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"SHOOTING STORIES, BROADCASTING MEMORIES"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Audio Visual Aid Club is a key service provider for school events
and assemblies. It has to provide timely and efficient support for many
school events, including assembly programs, annual speech days, Student
Leaders Investiture, National Day celebrations and many others. Through
the experience of capable support rendered to the school, AVA students
get to develop core technical and effective troubleshooting skills, learn
to work as a cohesive team and cultivate a disciplined attitude.</p>
<p>Apart from providing audio visual aid, AVA members attend CCA training
twice weekly where they learn videography and editing skills, which allows
them to produce various videos and animation clips. Our students also actively
and regularly participate in many video competitions, which allows them
to put to refine their skills and to put them to good use.</p>

<h3><strong>Blurbs</strong></h3>
<p>Being a member of the AVA Club has been an incredible and fulfilling journey,
full of unforgettable memories. During my time in the club, I gained many
unique experiences and skills, from operating the PA system to filming
and editing videos. I am honoured to have been a part of such a bonded
family. <strong><em>-Nai’mah (4C2), AVA President</em></strong>
