<h2><strong>INNOVATION AND ENTERPRISE CLUB</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“DESIGN. THINK BIG. THINK DIFFERENT. BELIEVE. CREATE. MAKE.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Innovation and Enterprise (I&amp;E) Club comprises a close-knit team
of students with a deep passion for ideation, design thinking and business
enterprise.</p>
<p>In I&amp;E Club, we do believe that character is destiny; that we should
demonstrate sincerity, courtesy and generosity in every aspect of our lives.
This, coupled with recognition of each and every member’s skills and potential,
enables us to strive for excellence in our endeavours.</p>
<p>Being in I&amp;E Club means getting oneself exposed to a myriad of activities
that include professional training, business skills and entrepreneurship
competitions, social enterprise, community involvement programmes and student-initiated
campus events. Through participation in various competitions, professional
trainers may also be engaged to run workshops and courses while industry
partners may also be roped in as mentors, sharing invaluable experiences
that add value to student learning.</p>
<p>When it comes to training, each I&amp;E Club member would have undergone
in-house basic training to pick up vital business skills such as accounting,
financial planning, business proposal writing, making a sales pitch, business
presentation, business marketing et cetera. The design and implementation
of the training programme enables the senior members to be servant leaders
and apply what they have learnt to guide the juniors in various roles as
instructors, facilitators and mentors. Through these four years of learning
experiences, the members have also fostered a sense of camaraderie, inspired
by a shared vision and encouraged by each other’s passion and teamwork.</p>
<p>To walk the talk, I&amp;E Club members apply what they have learned about
entrepreneurship through participating in different competitions that would
require them to demonstrate a myriad of proficiencies. These include financial
literacy, design thinking, social innovation, creativity and innovation,
critical thinking and problem solving, oral communication, civic literacy,
ICT literacy, cross-cultural skills — most of which are key 21st Century
Competencies, moulding each I&amp;E Club member into confident ladies and
leaders of tomorrow. From displaying a knack for financial literacy in
the National Cashflow Challenge to exercising efficient interpersonal and
communication skills in pitching their ideas and prototypes to judges,
industry experts and peers, the I&amp;E Club members have learned to be
flexible and confident aspiring entrepreneurs with a spirit of giving back
to the community.</p>

<h3><strong>Blurbs</strong></h3>
<p>“Being in the Innovation and Enterprise Club (I&amp;E) has nurtured me
in many aspects of life. I have greatly improved my problem-solving skills,
my ability to work in a team and have learnt to empathise with people in
our society. Through working in different projects, I have learnt crucial
21st century competencies like being an active contributor and a self-directed
learner. I am honoured to have the position of CEO as our CCA is full of
amicable and good-hearted people.” - <strong><em>Dhruvi Verma of 4S2 (2024)&nbsp;–on what she has gained from I&amp;E Club</em></strong>
</p>
<p>“I was really excited to join I&amp;E ever since the start. &nbsp;I was
pleasantly surprised at how welcoming and nurturing the CCA was. From sec
1, I have learnt a lot of real-life skills that involve communication and
real-world problem solving. I’m truly grateful for how this CCA has shaped
me and am looking to apply what i have learnt in the future!”&nbsp;<strong><em>- Aloysius Rhea of 4S1 (2024) on what she has learnt from I&amp;E Club</em></strong>
</p>
<p>“Being a Human Resource manager has given me many opportunities to step
out of my comfort zone to interact with and guide people through vastly
accumulated past experiences, stemming from appropriate self-expression
and maturity. In this CCA, I have grown to become much more open-minded
and creatively communicative, adapting to a mock representation of working
along with colleagues under different circumstances and coming up with
solutions to problem pains through establishing good teamwork and helping
one another out. I have helped out many of my juniors and learnt from my
seniors to the best of my abilities. Remembering the sheer passion and
close-knit bonds fostered, I will never forget being in this CCA.” <strong><em>- Xue Aili Crystal of 4G1 (2023) on how I&amp;E Club has contributed to her holistic development</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Being the Marketing and Communications director of Innovation and Enterprise
club has provided me with ample opportunities to learn about finance management
and more about the business industry. I&amp;E has helped me to become more
creative and conceptualise ideas better. I’m glad to have been given the
opportunity to lead the CCA and acquire these skills beneficial to my growth. <strong><em>- Chai Sheenyee of 4S1 (2023) on how I&amp;E Club has developed her as a student leader</em></strong>
</p>
<p>“As a member and CEO of I&amp;E, I have gained a great deal of knowledge
regarding finance, business management, and product development. Over the
years, the CCA has helped me grow into a more confident and capable person,
and I'm glad to have been a part of it!”&nbsp;<strong><em>- Nuhaa Afaf Aman&nbsp;of 4S2 (2023) on what she has learned from being involved in the CCA</em></strong>
</p>
<p>“Being a part of Innovation and Enterprise Club has taught me a lot of
valuable skills which are most definitely useful in the future such as
expressing my ideas effectively and good communication skills. It has also
given me the opportunity to make a lot of memories with my batch mates
and club members, through events such as preparations for competitions,
party planning sessions and training and bonding sessions, ones which I
will never forget. Being part of the EXCO also gave me a chance to give
back to the CCA that has taught me so much and provided me with countless
opportunities.&nbsp;&nbsp;CCA definitely has been one of the best parts
of my secondary school life, I made so many friends here who I know I can
always rely on for any help. I&amp;E is not just a CCA; it's a family. <strong><em>- Lanka Lakshmi Kaivalya of 4C2 (2023) on how she has benefited from her CCA involvement</em></strong>
