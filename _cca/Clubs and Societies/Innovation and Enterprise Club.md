## **INNOVATION AND ENTERPRISE CLUB**

&gt; “DESIGN. THINK BIG. THINK DIFFERENT. BELIEVE. CREATE. MAKE.”

The Innovation and Enterprise (I&amp;E) Club comprises a close-knit team of students with a deep passion for ideation, design thinking and business enterprise. In I&amp;E Club, we do believe that character is destiny; that we should demonstrate sincerity, courtesy and generosity in every aspect of our lives. This, coupled with recognition of every member’s skills and potential, enable us to strive for excellence in our endeavours.

Being in I&amp;E Club means getting oneself exposed to a myriad of activities that include professional training, business skills and entrepreneurship competitions, social enterprise, community involvement programmes and student-initiated campus events. Through participation in various competitions, professional trainers may also be engaged to run workshops and courses while industry partners may also be roped in as mentors, sharing invaluable experiences that add value to student learning. Some of the competitions include that of financial literacy, design thinking, social innovation, creativity and innovation, critical thinking and problem solving, oral communication, civic literacy, ICT literacy, cross-cultural skills — most of which are key 21st Century Competencies, moulding each I&amp;E Club member into confident ladies and leaders of tomorrow. From displaying a knack for financial literacy in the National Cashflow Challenge to exercising efficient interpersonal and communication skills in pitching their ideas and prototypes to judges, industry experts and peers, the I&amp;E Club members have learned to be flexible and confident aspiring entrepreneurs with a spirit of giving back to the community.

When it comes to training, each I&amp;E Club member would have undergone in-house basic training to pick up vital business skills such as accounting, financial planning, business proposal writing, making a sales pitch, business presentation, business marketing et cetera. The design and implementation of the training programme enables the senior members to be servant leaders and apply what they have learnt to guide the juniors in various roles as instructors, facilitators, and mentors. Through these four years, I&amp;E also seeks to foster a sense of camaraderie among its members, as they work towards their shared vision with passion and teamwork.
