<h2><strong>INNOVATION AND ENTERPRISE CLUB</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“DESIGN. THINK BIG. THINK DIFFERENT. BELIEVE. CREATE. MAKE.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Innovation and Enterprise (I&amp;E) Club comprises a close-knit team
of students with a deep passion for ideation, design thinking and business
enterprise.</p>
<p>In I&amp;E Club, we do believe that character is destiny; that we should
demonstrate sincerity, courtesy and generosity in every aspect of our lives.
This, coupled with recognition of each and every member’s skills and potential,
enables us to strive for excellence in our endeavours.</p>
<p>Being in I&amp;E Club means getting oneself exposed to a myriad of activities
that include professional training, business skills and entrepreneurship
competitions, social enterprise, community involvement programmes and student-initiated
campus events. Through participation in various competitions, professional
trainers may also be engaged to run workshops and courses while industry
partners may also be roped in as mentors, sharing invaluable experiences
that add value to student learning.</p>
<p>When it comes to training, each I&amp;E Club member would have undergone
in-house basic training to pick up vital business skills such as accounting,
financial planning, business proposal writing, making a sales pitch, business
presentation, business marketing et cetera. The design and implementation
of the training programme enables the senior members to be servant leaders
and apply what they have learnt to guide the juniors in various roles as
instructors, facilitators and mentors. Through these four years of learning
experiences, the members have also fostered a sense of camaraderie, inspired
by a shared vision and encouraged by each other’s passion and teamwork.</p>
<p>To walk the talk, I&amp;E Club members apply what they have learned about
entrepreneurship through participating in different competitions that would
require them to demonstrate a myriad of proficiencies. These include financial
literacy, design thinking, social innovation, creativity and innovation,
critical thinking and problem solving, oral communication, civic literacy,
ICT literacy, cross-cultural skills — most of which are key 21st Century
Competencies, moulding each I&amp;E Club member into confident ladies and
leaders of tomorrow. From displaying a knack for financial literacy in
the National Cashflow Challenge to exercising efficient interpersonal and
communication skills in pitching their ideas and prototypes to judges,
industry experts and peers, the I&amp;E Club members have learned to be
flexible and confident aspiring entrepreneurs with a spirit of giving back
to the community.</p>
