## **Digital Art and Photography Club (DAPC)**

Crescent’s Digital Art and Photography Club (DAPC) aims to cultivate students’ interests, confidence and expertise in using both photography and art as mediums to communicate thoughts, feelings, and positive messages. Activities conducted during CCA sessions are geared towards developing the students’ technical skills as well as soft skills such as teamwork, project management, communication, discipline, and a keen appreciation for beauty.

Students are also given various opportunities to showcase their skills in national competitions throughout the year such as Our School Our Stories, #ClickArt, and the Live On Festival. They are also crucial in helping to capture beautiful memories during school events such as concerts and sporting events.

Students will go through a basic photography course when they join the CCA. This course will equip them with the necessary skills to handle the camera and the various composition techniques. After this course, students will continue to develop their skills through an intermediate documentary photography course in which they will also enhance their photo-editing techniques.

For digital art, students will be given the opportunity to use different types of software such as Adobe Lightroom, Reality Composer, Snapseed, and Procreate to bring their ideas to life – be it through digital design and animation or the creation of objects in augmented reality.

Not only has it allowed me to explore my creative side, but it has also provided me with a sense of belonging and community. Through DAPC, I have been able to meet like-minded CCA mates who share my passion for artistic expression. This has not only expanded my social circle but has also given me the opportunity to learn from others and improve my skills. Additionally, being part of the CCA has boosted my confidence and self-esteem, as I have received recognition for my artworks. The projects we work on during CCA sessions allow me to bond with my CCA mates and sharpen my art skills. By working together with different people in the CCA, I am able to learn from others and teach others what they might not know. Joining DAPC has been a transformative journey that has enriched my life and exposed me to the world of art in countless ways.” ***- Jaimee Wong (2S1)***

“When I first joined DAPC, I expected to receive just basic exposure to art and photography. However, I got so much more than that. I have made many friends who share my passion for art and photography and honed my skills in using a digital camera. All in all, I enjoy being in DAPC and learning skills that can stick with me for a lifetime.” ***-Sim Gretchen (2G1)***

"The minute my Apple Pencil touched my iPad and I embarked on my first drawing, I knew that being in DAPC was the right choice. My CCA experience was further enhanced when I became equipped with basic photography skills and found my true passion - photography. Although I am not very good at drawing, my wonderful seniors have always been there for me, helping me when I was unsure how to go about my drawings. I am very grateful to be a part of DAPC and look forward to every moment spent drawing or taking photos.”***-Miraya Jolly (1G2)***
