<h2><strong>INTERNATIONAL CHESS</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"EVERY PAWN IS A POTENTIAL QUEEN"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crescent Chess club is a Co-Curricular Activity where we come together
to share our deep passion for chess. Chess is akin to a form of art — a
canvas of sixty-four squares where each move and strategy can be refined
and perfected with endless possibilities. During these sessions, our professional
chess coach, Woman Fide Master (WFM) Thandar Aye Win, teaches us the spotting
of tactics and game strategies. We then engage in thrilling chess games
that puts our knowledge and skills we have learned to the test. Alongside
our matches, our coach challenges us with intricate chess puzzles that
train our problem-solving skills and develop our ability to spot similar
patterns in our games. Chess Club members are encouraged to interact with
each other in the form of chess variants like bughouse, four-player chess,
and simuls.</p>
<p>In Chess Club, a strong bond among the club members is forged through
playing the game with one another and getting to know them better in the
process. With warm and embracing coach and club members, there will always
be others to seek guidance from. There are also many opportunities to gain
experience such as in inter-school and external competitions. Some of these
include the National School Individuals (NSI) and the National School Team
Championship (NST).</p>
