<h2><strong>INTERNATIONAL CHESS</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"EVERY PAWN IS A POTENTIAL QUEEN"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crescent Chess club is a Co-Curricular Activity where we come together
to share our deep passion for chess. The Chess Club holds its sessions
every Monday and Wednesday, from 3 to 5pm. Chess is akin to a form of art
— a canvas of sixty-four squares where each move and strategy can be refined
and perfected with endless possibilities. During these sessions, our professional
chess coach, Woman Fide Master (WFM) Thandar Aye Win, teaches us the spotting
of tactics and game strategies. We then engage in thrilling chess games
that puts our knowledge and skills we have learned to the test. Alongside
our matches, our coach challenges us with intricate chess puzzles that
train our problem-solving skills and develop our ability to spot similar
patterns in our games. Chess Club members are encouraged to interact with
each other in the form of chess variants like bughouse, four-player chess,
and simuls.</p>
<p>In Chess Club, a strong bond among the club members is forged through
playing the game with one another and getting to know them better in the
process. With warm and embracing coach and club members, there will always
be others to seek guidance from. There are also many opportunities to gain
experience such as in inter-school and external competitions. Some of these
include the National School Individuals (NSI) and the National School Team
Championship (NST).</p>

<h3><strong>Blurbs</strong></h3>
<p>I have absolutely zero regrets joining chess. This chess club is not just
a group of students who can play chess, but a family, who has walked with
me on this incredible journey for about three years now. From a Secondary
One student who had countless doubts about her ability, I have gained confidence
over time with the unceasing reassurance from my peers and coach, and eventually
joined Singapore’s National Junior Development Squad (NJDS). I have also
seen this club grow with each passing year, and my absolute favourite quality
about us is that we do not give up. After every defeat, we pick ourselves
up, train harder, and fight even harder the next time round. I have never
once felt forced to train because this club has truly helped me to inculcate
a love for chess which makes me strive to put in more effort each time.
Getting the opportunity to be the president of this CCA which I call home
is certainly a great honour, and I have grown to learn to step out of my
comfort zone to lead this CCA to greater heights. From the bottom of my
heart, I cannot thank you enough, Crescent Chess! <strong><em>- Yip Ruo Yao (3S1), President of Chess Club 2023/2024</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Chess has empowered me to think better and smarter. Every chess game is
different and unique which requires me to practise every variation possible.
Chess is also a &nbsp;&nbsp;game which allows me to manage my time better,
and I also always have a great time playing Chess and forging closer bonds
with my Chess Club friends. <strong><em>- Chuan Wen Xin (3S2), Vice-President of Chess Club 2023/2024</em></strong>
</p>
<p>I was really weak in chess previously but when I joined Crescent Chess
Club, I gained confidence in it because of the training as well as the
strong bond we have as a chess club. Joining Crescent Chess Club is a decision
I will never regret. <strong><em>-Annette Sophie Tay (2S1)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Chess Club has not only improved my chess skills but also my confidence
in general. Previously, I had no confidence in myself. When I joined chess
club and improved my chess skills, winning games has been a way to boost
my confidence. The teachers-in-charge, coach, and club mates are extremely
helpful and supportive. I would definitely recommend the Chess Club to
my juniors. <strong><em>- Viveka Mohan Amarnani (2G2)</em></strong>
