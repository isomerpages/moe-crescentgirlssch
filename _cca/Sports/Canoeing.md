## ** CANOEING**
&gt; “ONE MILLION PERCENT!”

The Crescent Canoeing team is one of the few all-girls teams in the sport and has been flourishing under the guidance of former Youth World Champion and current coach, Mr Denes Szaszak, a Hungarian national who also coaches our Singapore National Team.

The team trains at the MacRitchie Reservoir and is one of the few sports that can truly be called an outdoor sport. Being surrounded by nature while paddling is not only a refreshing change to the urban setting we are usually in, but also a great way for the students to be more connected to nature.

With the team motto and cheer being “One Million Percent!”, the team trains hard and gives their all during training and races. The team has performed well in recent years, constantly being in the top 3 nationally. The student-athletes are given plenty of race experience throughout their four years with the team, and many of them are often invited to train with the national youth team from as young as 14 years old.

Apart from training and races, the team also has bonding events such as our annual Family Day where we invite parents and family to paddle together, as well as the year-end camp where we engage in activities together and foster closer relationships.

At Crescent Canoeing, we don’t just train athletes to win in races. Through instilling discipline and the desire to strive for excellence, we develop students who will go through life with the same mentality, excelling in any field that they go into.<br>

“Being part of Crescent Canoeing has taught me the significance of consistent effort in achieving success. Despite many of us lacking prior experience in water sports, our team improved rapidly by training diligently. While canoeing may appear to be an individual sport, we have a strong sense of camaraderie, supporting one another on and off water. The team spirit and friendships fostered has made CCA an incredibly enriching and memorable part of my secondary school experience.” ***Shantell Wong&nbsp;(4S2), Team Captain 2022-2023,&nbsp;on what&nbsp;she&nbsp;has&nbsp;learnt from being&nbsp;a Canoeist&nbsp;for the past 4 years.***

“Canoeing has taught me about the importance of team spirit. Even when training is tough, I look around and see my friends trying their best and I feel encouraged to do the same. We always push each other to be the best we can be for the team.” ***Bhavya Musunuri (3S1), Team Vice-Captain 2023-2024, on what drives her during training.***

“Being in canoeing has made me stronger, not just physically but mentally as well. It has taught me many lessons that I’ll always remember, from working together as a team to never giving up no matter how hard it gets. Working together as a team has bonded us and the friendships I’ve made in canoeing are ones I will always cherish.” ***Sakura Therese Soon Wen Ying&nbsp; (2S1)&nbsp;on being stronger in character.***

“Being part of the Canoeing CCA has been a really fun and interesting experience for me. I have been in this CCA for about half a year now, and throughout this time, I have learnt a lot about teamwork, being responsible and taking action without others having to remind me to do so. I would like to thank all the teachers, seniors and coach for teaching and guiding us all the way. This is definitely one of the best things I enjoy about Crescent.” ***Charlotte Filia Nugraha&nbsp;(1G1)&nbsp;&nbsp;on being a new member in the team.***
