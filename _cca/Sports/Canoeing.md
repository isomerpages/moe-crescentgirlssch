<h2>CANOEING</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“ONE MILLION PERCENT!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Crescent Canoeing team is one of the few all-girls teams in the sport
and has been flourishing under the guidance of former Youth World Champion
and current coach, Mr Denes Szaszak, a Hungarian national who also coaches
our Singapore National Team.</p>
<p>The team trains at the MacRitchie Reservoir and is one of the few sports
that can truly be called an outdoor sport. Being surrounded by nature while
paddling is not only a refreshing change to the urban setting we are usually
in, but also a great way for the students to be more connected to nature.</p>
<p>With the team motto and cheer being “One Million Percent!”, the team trains
hard and gives their all during training and races. The team has performed
well in recent years, constantly being in the top 3 nationally. The student-athletes
are given plenty of race experience throughout their four years with the
team, and many of them are often invited to train with the national youth
team from as young as 14 years old.</p>
<p>Apart from training and races, the team also has bonding events such as
our annual Family Day where we invite parents and family to paddle together,
as well as the year-end camp where we engage in activities together and
foster closer relationships.</p>
<p>At Crescent Canoeing, we don’t just train athletes to win in races. Through
instilling discipline and the desire to strive for excellence, we develop
students who will go through life with the same mentality, excelling in
any field that they go into.

<h3><strong>Blurbs</strong></h3>
<p>Joining the Crescent Canoeing team has truly changed me for the better.
Every training session builds and tests our perseverance and determination,
but at the end of the day, the biggest takeaway I have from this CCA is
team spirit. I learnt that the biggest sense of accomplishment comes when
efforts pay off and we win together as a team. These invaluable lessons
have made Canoeing CCA a highlight of my Crescent journey. <strong><em>- Ariel Loh Zhi Lin (3S6), Team Vice-captain 2024-2025</em></strong>

<p>Canoeing has significantly enhanced my resilience and tenacity. Over the
past three years, I've been pushed both physically and mentally to become
the best version of myself, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to grow
in character. Although training gets tough, it is reassuring to know that
a supportive and encouraging team always has my back. I love Canoeing and
am glad that I chose to be part of this team! <strong><em>- Athena Clare Tham Yun Kay (3C1), Team Vice-Captain 2024-2025</em></strong>

<p>“Canoeing? What’s that? Let me put it for fun in my CCA choices!” This
was a sentence I said to my friends in Secondary One. Although not one
of my top choices, I am extremely glad that I ended up in the CCA! We are
an enthusiastic team that always supports one another despite any challenges
faced. Through the friendships and bonds fostered within the CCA, Crescent
Canoeing is like my second family. We go through common experiences together,
sweat together, laugh together, and most importantly cherish each other. <strong><em>- Sherlene Ng Rui Xuan (3S7), Team Captain 2024-2025</em></strong>

<p>Being in Crescent Canoeing has allowed me to grow as a person and become
a stronger athlete. It taught me the importance of perseverance and sportsmanship.
Going through hardships, celebrating achievements, always supporting each
other and shouting encouragements across the water are what bonds our team.
This CCA is the main part of my Crescent journey and has allowed me to
create long lasting memories that I will forever cherish.” <strong><em>- Juliana Wang Jinrong (3S6)</em></strong>

<p>Joining Crescent Canoeing has exposed me to many opportunities to race
and represent our school, improve myself and learn what the true essence
of perseverance really means. This CCA has helped to develop me into a
resilient and responsible person as we must take very good care of our
equipment. It has also taught me that training hard and preparing well
for our races is key. <strong><em>- Dorcas Koh Shun Hee (2G2)</em></strong>

<p></p>
<p>Joining Crescent Canoeing has been a transformative experience for me
these past two years. Each competition and training allowed us to grow,
both individually and as a team. Through victories and defeats, we developed
not just athletic abilities, but also confidence and leadership qualities.
My teammates have built a strong bond, and we encourage each other to improve
and grow to be better canoeists. Being in Crescent Canoeing has been a
wonderful experience for me! <strong><em>- Shabnam Jochebed Blessy (2C1)</em></strong>
