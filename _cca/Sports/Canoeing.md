<h2>CANOEING</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“ONE MILLION PERCENT!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Crescent Canoeing team is one of the few all-girls teams in the sport
and has been flourishing under the guidance of former Youth World Champion
and current coach, Mr Denes Szaszak, a Hungarian national who also coaches
our Singapore National Team.</p>
<p>The team trains at the MacRitchie Reservoir and is one of the few sports
that can truly be called an outdoor sport. Being surrounded by nature while
paddling is not only a refreshing change to the urban setting we are usually
in, but also a great way for the students to be more connected to nature.</p>
<p>With the team motto and cheer being “One Million Percent!”, the team trains
hard and gives their all during training and races. The team has performed
well in recent years, constantly being in the top 3 nationally. The student-athletes
are given plenty of race experience throughout their four years with the
team, and many of them are often invited to train with the national youth
team from as young as 14 years old.</p>
<p>Apart from training and races, the team also has bonding events such as
our annual Family Day where we invite parents and family to paddle together,
as well as the year-end camp where we engage in activities together and
foster closer relationships.</p>
<p>At Crescent Canoeing, we don’t just train athletes to win in races. Through
instilling discipline and the desire to strive for excellence, we develop
students who will go through life with the same mentality, excelling in
any field that they go into.
