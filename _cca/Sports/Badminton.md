<h2><strong>Badminton</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“IGNITE THE FIRE WITHIN!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crescent Badminton’s vision is to instill&nbsp;character building through
positive competition and to achieve excellence in competitions.</p>
<p>Badminton is a fast-paced sport which requires not only agility, power,
but also high mental endurance. That is why Crescent Badminton has always
been persistent in terms of perfecting our skills, improving our agility
as well as pushing our own boundaries during our training sessions, which
are held twice a week, in order to bring the team to even greater heights.
In 2023, Crescent Badminton was able to reap the fruits of our labour,
with the B Division attaining 1st Runner-up, and the C Division attaining
2nd Runner-up in the South Zone National School Games.</p>
<p>Crescent Badminton has been actively participating in many competitions,
such as the annual South Zone Inter-School Badminton Championships and
many other friendly matches against opponents from other schools. These
competitions not only allow our players to put what they have learnt from
training sessions into practice, but also give us an opportunity to learn
from our opponents, allowing us to improve our skills as well as our strategies.</p>
<p>Over the past year, while there is no doubt that Crescent Badminton has
grown significantly in terms of skills and agility, we have also grown
closer as a team. As we become more agile, our ability to tackle obstacles
gets better. &nbsp;While our smashes become more powerful, our love for
the team has also grown stronger.</p>
<p>We will continue to work hard and give our all for the team, and we hope
to help Crescent Badminton scale even greater heights and achieve even
more outstanding results in the near future.</p>
