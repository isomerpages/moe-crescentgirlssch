&gt; “IGNITE THE FIRE WITHIN!”

Crescent Badminton’s vision is to instill&nbsp;character building through positive competition and to achieve excellence in competitions.

Badminton is a fast-paced sport which requires not only agility, power, but also high mental endurance. That is why Crescent Badminton has always been persistent in terms of perfecting our skills, improving our agility as well as pushing our own boundaries during our training sessions, which are held twice a week, in order to bring the team to even greater heights. In 2023, Crescent Badminton was able to reap the fruits of our labour, with the B Division attaining 1st Runner-up, and the C Division attaining 2nd Runner-up in the South Zone National School Games.

Crescent Badminton has been actively participating in many competitions, such as the annual South Zone Inter-School Badminton Championships and many other friendly matches against opponents from other schools. These competitions not only allow our players to put what they have learnt from training sessions into practice, but also give us an opportunity to learn from our opponents, allowing us to improve our skills as well as our strategies.

Over the past year, while there is no doubt that Crescent Badminton has grown significantly in terms of skills and agility, we have also grown closer as a team. As we become more agile, our ability to tackle obstacles gets better. &nbsp;While our smashes become more powerful, our love for the team has also grown stronger.

We will continue to work hard and give our all for the team, and we hope to help Crescent Badminton scale even greater heights and achieve even more outstanding results in the near future.

“Badminton has been such an enjoyable sport for me and has taught me about the importance of teamwork. It is particularly true when I partner someone else during doubles, as I have to work and communicate with my partner. On the whole, my involvement in the Badminton Team has been a very fulfilling experience and it has taught me many good things.”
