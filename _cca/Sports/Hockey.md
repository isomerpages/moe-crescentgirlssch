<h2><strong>HOCKEY</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"WIN OR DON'T GO HOME!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crescent Hockey has a long history dating back to 1959 and is one of the
longest running CCAs in Crescent Girls' School. In the early years, Crescent
Hockey gradually gained recognition by achieving numerous awards in both
district and national tournaments under the guidance of the teacher-in-charge
and former coach, Mr Julian Hwang. The senior team had its first taste
of winning when it clinched the first position in the District Tournament
in 1971, followed by the junior team in 1975. In 1995, Mr Nordin Manaff
took over Mr Julian Hwang’s position as coach. Under Mr Nordin's leadership
and guidance, Crescent Hockey has continued to excel and has emerged consistently
as one of the top 4 teams in the National School Games competition.</p>
<p>Since the resumption of the National School Games after the COVID pandemic,
Crescent Hockey has continued to achieved stellar results. In 2022, Crescent
emerged as double champions, bringing both the ‘B’ and ‘C’ Division Championship
home. In the year 2023, we were 2nd runners-up for the 'B' Division and
once again achieved gold in the 'C' Division Championship. Most recently
in 2024, we were 1st runners-up in the 'B' Division and also emerged as
champions in the 'C' Division.</p>
<p>These accolades do not come easy. Over the years, many Crescent Hockey
teams have repeatedly paid and continue to pay the price of excellence.
Hard work and dedication have long been the definitive culture of all Crescent
Hockey teams and is most clearly demonstrated during training sessions
which take place on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. In order for our
players to play at their peak, these sessions include fitness and agility
training as well. Additionally, we place significant emphasis on the theoretical
aspects of the game and engage our players in theory lessons through video
analysis of their games. We also participate in national leagues and by
pitting ourselves against tougher opponents, our players will be able to
gain valuable experience which will definitely aid them in the long run.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, to ensure that members of the team benefit from a holistic
development, the teachers regularly review the academic performance and
general conduct of the individual members of the Crescent Hockey team.
This is to better support the team and to introduce assistive structures
if deemed necessary.</p>
<p>To ensure that Crescent Hockey community upholds the spirit of togetherness,
the Crescent Hockey Club was formed in 2002 by ex-Crescentians. Through
this club, hockey carnivals and past versus present games are held occasionally
to enable the current generation of Crescent Hockey players to bond with
their seniors. This is to provide an opportunity for Crescentians to interact
with one another, share their experiences and most importantly, to create
a sense of belonging towards what we call, the Crescent Hockey Family.</p>

<h3><strong>BLURBS:</strong></h3>
<p>During my time in Crescent Hockey, I have learnt to be a leader that displays
sportsmanship. I have also been given the opportunity to forge new friendships
and improve my skills. Trainings are always filled with laughter and joy
and there was never once where I dreaded training, always taking away a
valuable lesson from the sessions. Though training would occasionally be
tough, the support from Coach Nordin and teachers is what keeps us going.
Overall, I do not have any regret joining Crescent Hockey. I will be forever
grateful to have a team that works hard and archive great things together
as one. Crescent Hockey #1! - <strong><em>Beth Chow (2G2)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>I have made unforgettable memories and strong bonds throughout my four
years in Crescent Hockey. It has taught me invaluable lessons— discipline,
teamwork, resilience, and, of course, the CresDIET values that guide us
every day.</p>
<p>One of the most important lessons I have learned is the significance of
teamwork. Crescent Hockey is unique because of how tightly-knit we are
as a CCA. Over the four years, I have realized that teamwork is essential
in hockey, especially since it is a team sport. Clear communication and
cooperation are key to our success, and it is what helps Crescent Hockey
consistently achieve top-three finishes every year.</p>
<p>What I enjoy most is how inclusive the CCA feels. Everyone is committed
to working together to improve both our skills and our team chemistry.
Attending CCA has never felt like a chore because I have always been surrounded
by positive, hardworking, and caring teammates, coaches, and teachers.
Whether it is during trainings or competition, hockey has given me the
most unforgettable memories, filled with both laughter and challenges,
all shared with an amazing team. I am extremely grateful for the experiences
and friendships that Crescent Hockey has brought into my life. <strong>- Anisah Musfirah (4G1)</strong>
