<h2><strong>TRACK AND FIELD</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Champions are made through determination and dedication.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Track and Field encompasses a variety of competitive athletic disciplines
based on running, jumping and throwing. Running events are categorized
into sprints (100-metres, 200-metres and 400-metres events), middle-distance
(800-meters, 1500-metres and 3000-meters), long-distance events (5000-meters
and 10,000-metres), hurdling and relay events (4 x 100-meters relay and
4 x 400-metres relay). Jumping events include the long jump, triple jump,
high jump and pole vault. Throwing events can include the short put, discus
throw and hammer throw.</p>
<p>Training takes place 2 to 3 times a week, either in school or at the Evans
Road Stadium, and focuses on developing our team’s muscular endurance,
flexibility, stamina and strength. The training is challenging, both physically
as well as mentally, and helps develop resilience and tenacity in our athletes.</p>
<p>The two biggest events of the year for us are the National Inter-school
Cross Country Championships and the National Inter-school Track &amp; Field
Championships where we compete with other secondary schools nationally.</p>
<p>Through competition, we aim to develop in our team a greater appreciation
for the sport as well as the qualities of sportsmanship, teamwork and strength
of character. It is more important to focus on the process than the product.
The process in this case are the gruelling hours of training we put in
every week, the soreness we deal with after and the mental endurance we
need to have to push ourselves beyond what we think we are capable of.
The product – the results medals and accolades – will follow later. It
is not always easy and there will be some very trying times. However, overcoming
these challenges is very rewarding and the team will emerge stronger, faster
and more united.</p>
<p>Track and Field at Crescent Girls’ School is more than just a series of
events; it is a gateway to personal growth, physical health, and the building
of strong character. We embrace the spirit of athleticism, determination,
and excellence.</p>
