<h2><strong>TRACK AND FIELD</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Champions are made through determination and dedication.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Track and Field encompasses a variety of competitive athletic disciplines
based on running, jumping and throwing. Running events are categorized
into sprints (100-metres, 200-metres and 400-metres events), middle-distance
(800-meters, 1500-metres and 3000-meters), long-distance events (5000-meters
and 10,000-metres), hurdling and relay events (4 x 100-meters relay and
4 x 400-metres relay). Jumping events include the long jump, triple jump,
high jump and pole vault. Throwing events can include the short put, discus
throw and hammer throw.</p>
<p>Training takes place 2 to 3 times a week, either in school or at the Co-Curricular
Activities Branch along Evans Road, and focuses on developing our team’s
muscular endurance, flexibility, stamina and strength. The training is
challenging, both physically as well as mentally, and helps develop resilience
and tenacity in our athletes.</p>
<p>Competitions are held throughout the year for different disciplines and
traditions; our strength has been in running events. Some events we compete
in are the Akira-Swift Road Relay Championships, the Akira-Swift Cross
Country Championships and the Singapore Athletic Association Track and
Field Series 6. The two biggest events of the year for us are the National
Inter-school Cross Country Championships and the National Inter-school
Track &amp; Field Championships where we compete with other secondary schools
nationally.</p>
<p>Through competition, we aim to develop in our team a greater appreciation
for the sport as well as the qualities of sportsmanship, teamwork and strength
of character. It is more important to focus on the process than the product.
The process in this case are the gruelling hours of training we put in
every week, the soreness we deal with after and the mental endurance we
need to have to push ourselves beyond what we think we are capable of.
The product – the results medals and accolades – will follow later. It
is not always easy and there will be some very trying times. However, overcoming
these challenges is very rewarding and the team will emerge stronger, faster
and more united.</p>
<p>Track and Field at Crescent Girls’ School is more than just a series of
events; it is a gateway to personal growth, physical health, and the building
of strong character. We embrace the spirit of athleticism, determination,
and excellence.</p>

<h3><strong>Blurbs</strong></h3>
<p>Being a part of Crescent’s track team has made my life in Crescent a fulfilling
one. It has taught me values that are essential in our day to day lives
such as teamwork, perseverance and determination through the training sessions
and competitions. Furthermore, i have forged many friendships along the
way and would never trade them for anything else. <strong><em>- Kristlyn Faith Tan, 2C1</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Track has shaped me into who I am today, this sport is a lot more than
just running rounds every training, I have learnt to be a more resilient
person and it has truly shown me what great measure of dedication, hard
work and passion it takes to become a great athlete. Through the tough
moments in training, we find our teammates going through the same shared
experiences and it builds great camaraderie within the team and we subconsciously
find ourselves finding joy in running. Track is such a huge part of my
life and I could not be anymore grateful for it! <strong><em>- (Captain) Poh Ming Xuan Hailey, 3G5</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Joining track was a decision I have never regretted. I have definitely
grown as a person, developing physical and mental stamina, while going
through the training programmes! In short, I am incredibly grateful to
track for giving me new opportunities and experiences, as well as showing
me the benefits of my hard work. <strong><em>- Chong Lynn Xi, 3C3</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Crescent Track has taught me grit, discipline, and instilled in me passion.
More than that, the friendships forged through the sweat, challenges and
accomplishments we shared are nothing short of invaluable to me. The memories
that I have made with Crescent Track are those that I will treasure forever
:) <strong><em>- Teo Swee Lin, 2C1</em></strong>
