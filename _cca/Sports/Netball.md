<h2><strong>NETBALL</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Netball in Crescent Girls’ School is an established and increasingly popular
CCA. Netball is a fast-paced game that not only requires good teamwork
and stamina but also quick and flexible thinking in order to strategize
effective gameplay.</p>
<p>In Crescent, training takes place twice a week, and three times a week
leading up to the National School Games season. Students are given ample
opportunities through their course of study to participate in netball competitions
and carnivals. Netball training includes strength-building and conditioning,
skills mastery, understanding of tactics through video analysis and court
games. This training not only builds up our members’ fitness and skills,
but also develops us in our perseverance and determination, reminding us
of the importance of never giving up. Although the long hours of training
under the hot sun can prove to be exhausting, the results attained on the
court is jubilantly gratifying</p>
<p>Crescent Netball is made up of dedicated netballers who have great passion
and drive. The team spirit of Netball is one that cannot be described in
words. The intangible feelings of familiarity, trust and comfort are unique
to Netballers. We are each other’s pillars of support, and we have Netball
to thank for bringing us together as one.</p>
