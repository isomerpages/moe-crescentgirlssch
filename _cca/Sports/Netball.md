## **NETBALL**
&gt; "TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK"

Netball in Crescent Girls’ School is an established and increasingly popular CCA. Netball is a fast-paced game that not only requires good teamwork and stamina but also quick and flexible thinking in order to strategize effective gameplay.

In Crescent, training takes place twice a week, and three times a week leading up to the National School Games season. Students are given ample opportunities through their course of study to participate in netball competitions and carnivals. Netball training includes strength-building and conditioning, skills mastery, understanding of tactics through video analysis and court games. This training not only builds up our members’ fitness and skills, but also develops us in our perseverance and determination, reminding us of the importance of never giving up. Although the long hours of training under the hot sun can prove to be exhausting, the results attained on the court is jubilantly gratifying

Crescent Netball is made up of dedicated netballers who have great passion and drive. The team spirit of Netball is one that cannot be described in words. The intangible feelings of familiarity, trust and comfort are unique to Netballers. We are each other’s pillars of support, and we have Netball to thank for bringing us together as one.
