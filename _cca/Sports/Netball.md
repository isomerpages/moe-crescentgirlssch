<h2><strong>NETBALL</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"TEAMWORK MAKES THE DREAM WORK"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Netball in Crescent Girls’ School is an established and increasingly popular
CCA. Netball is a fast-paced game that not only requires good teamwork
and stamina but also quick and flexible thinking in order to strategize
effective gameplay.</p>
<p>In Crescent, training takes place twice a week, and three times a week
leading up to the National School Games season. Students are given ample
opportunities through their course of study to participate in netball competitions
and carnivals. Netball training includes strength-building and conditioning,
skills mastery, understanding of tactics through video analysis and court
games. This training not only builds up our members’ fitness and skills,
but also develops us in our perseverance and determination, reminding us
of the importance of never giving up. Although the long hours of training
under the hot sun can prove to be exhausting, the results attained on the
court is jubilantly gratifying</p>
<p>Crescent Netball is made up of dedicated netballers who have great passion
and drive. The team spirit of Netball is one that cannot be described in
words. The intangible feelings of familiarity, trust and comfort are unique
to Netballers. We are each other’s pillars of support, and we have Netball
to thank for bringing us together as one.</p>

<p>Netball has taught me the importance of teamwork, communication and taking
feedback positively to help both ourselves and the team do better. During
netball we do different drills and play matches to both help the team and
us as individuals improve our skills. I find netball really fun and that
it has taught me lifelong skills, such as to be more open-minded and resilient
when facing challenges and to become a better player.&nbsp; - <strong>Maya Jonsson-Goh</strong>

<p>Netball has aided me in my pursuit of becoming a fitter individual, where
the tough training sessions have effectively inculcated a strong sense
of resilience and tenacity in me. This has made me adaptable to change
in my studies and other commitments. Weekly bonding and camaraderie with
my teammates and seniors alike add invaluable enjoyment to the sport, as
we forge lifelong friendships along the way! - <strong>Lim Yat Kwan Angel Wathida</strong>

<p>Being in the Netball CCA has made me a more versatile player. I have been
given opportunities to play different positions to experience what each
player goes through during a game. I have also learnt how to push through
even when I get tired or am facing challenges. Through Netball CCA, I have
learnt not only skills on court but also lifelong skills that will help
me in the future such as teamwork and being receptive to feedback. - <strong>Arwen Khor (Xu Kai Yi)</strong>

<p>With the support and guidance of my teachers and friends, I strive to

setbacks, the team works hard and does not give up. - <strong>Harinisree Venkatesan</strong>

<p>My Netball CCA experience has made me more receptive to feedback. I would
take feedback positively and find ways to work harder to become a better
