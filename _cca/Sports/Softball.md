<h2><strong>SOFTBALL</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"INDIVIDUALS PLAY THE GAME, BUT A TEAM WILL BEAT THE ODDS"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Crescent Softball team comprises of a group of promising and talented
athletes who are under the guidance of National Team player Coach Alvina
Chow and the teachers-in-charge.</p>
<p>Through our rigorous training sessions twice to thrice a week (depending
on the season), players have not only been able to improve their hard skills
(for example: basic throwing/catching and batting skills) but also able
to sharpen their soft skills such as teamwork. Softball training teaches
our players the importance of values like determination, passion and communication,
which are key in playing the game.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, our players are treated to an annual softball
camp, which is an excellent opportunity for players to foster camaraderie
and build team spirit and a sense of belonging. Through the activities
and games, the members challenge and push themselves beyond their comfort
zones and emerge a stronger and more formidable team.</p>
<p>We believe that as we continue to train hard, we will bring glory to Crescent.</p>
