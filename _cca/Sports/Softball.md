## **SOFTBALL**

>*"INDIVIDUAL PLAY THE GAME, BUT TEAMS BEAT THE ODDS"*

The Crescent Softball team comprises of a group of promising and talented athletes. Under the guidance of former National Team player Coach Marcus Yeo and teachers in charge, we have participated in many competitions and have successfully placed 3rd in the 2019 National Inter-School Games.

Through our rigorous training sessions thrice a week, players have not only been able to improve their hard skills (example: basic throwing/catching and batting skills), but have also been able to sharpen their soft skills such as teamwork. Softball training teaches our players the importance of values like determination, passion and communication, which is key in playing the game. 

At the end of the year, our players are treated to an annual softball camp, which is an excellent opportunity for players to improve their camaraderie, team spirit and sense of belonging. Through the activities and games, the members challenge and push themselves beyond their comfort zones and emerge as a stronger and more formidable team.

Even during the pandemic, the Softball team adapted and continued to meet online for theory lessons conducted by our Coach to learn about the theory and techniques required for Softball. The Softball team has the ability to withstand adversity and bounce back despite the current circumstances. We believe that as we continue to train hard, we will bring Crescent to glory.

“The Softball Team has taught me many important values such as teamwork, determination and resilience. Not giving up no matter how daunting the situation may be and being able to trust your teammates are some of the things I gradually developed. As the Vice\-captain, I may find the responsibility tough to handle at times, but my fellow teammates never fail to motivate me and lend a helping hand.”
