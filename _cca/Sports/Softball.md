<h2><strong>SOFTBALL</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"INDIVIDUALS PLAY THE GAME, BUT A TEAM WILL BEAT THE ODDS"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Crescent Softball team is made up of a group of promising and talented
athletes, guided by Coach Alvina Chow and our dedicated teachers-in-charge.</p>
<p>Through rigorous training sessions held two to three times a week—depending
on the season —our players continually develop both hard skills such as
throwing, catching, and batting, as well as soft skills like teamwork and
communication. More than just a sport, softball instills key values such
as determination, passion, and resilience, which are essential both on
the field and in life.</p>
<p>A highlight of the year is our annual softball camp, a special opportunity
for players to bond, challenge themselves, and strengthen team spirit.
Through a variety of engaging activities and games, players step out of
their comfort zones and grow—not just as athletes, but as individuals.</p>
<p>As we continue to train hard and grow together, we believe that we will
bring pride and glory to Crescent.</p>
