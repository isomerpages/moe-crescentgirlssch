<h2><strong>SOFTBALL</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"INDIVIDUAL PLAY THE GAME, BUT TEAMS BEAT THE ODDS"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Crescent Softball team comprises of a group of promising and talented
athletes who are under the guidance of National Team player Coach Alvina
Chow and the teachers-in-charge.</p>
<p>Through our rigorous training sessions twice to thrice a week (depending
on the season), players have not only been able to improve their hard skills
(for example: basic throwing/catching and batting skills) but also able
to sharpen their soft skills such as teamwork. Softball training teaches
our players the importance of values like determination, passion and communication,
which are key in playing the game.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, our players are treated to an annual softball
camp, which is an excellent opportunity for players to foster camaraderie
and build team spirit and a sense of belonging. Through the activities
and games, the members challenge and push themselves beyond their comfort
zones and emerge a stronger and more formidable team.</p>
<p>We believe that as we continue to train hard, we will bring glory to Crescent.</p>

<h3><strong>Blurbs</strong></h3>
<p>Softball has taught me many life skills that can be used in my future
endeavours such as perseverance, teamwork and sportsmanship. Training has
helped me become not only physically, but mentally stronger. I have learnt
that we should never give up even during tough situations and always strive
to do our best. I am able to apply these skills on a day-to-day basis,
shaping me into a better person. Overall, softball has helped me to improve
my physical and mental performance. - <strong>YEO JIN XUAN (C Division Vice captain and Catcher)</strong>

<p>Softball has taught me how to work well with others in a team as it is
a team sport. Through many tough training sessions, I have also learnt
many values such as resilience and responsibility, not giving up when facing
challenges and playing my part to lead the team to success. - <strong>WATT YU HENG JOCELYN</strong>  <strong>(C Div Pitcher)</strong>
</p>
<p>Joining CGS softball is truly a decision I will never regret. For the
rest of my life, I will hold near and dear to my heart the memories I have
made with my team, the adrenaline pumping games and the valuable life lessons.
Softball has taught me what it means to be an athlete, how to approach
life with drive, passion, discipline, resilience and the never-ending thirst
to strive for the best. It has truly been an honour to be captain of this
team.- <strong>ANGELINA CHANG XUE LING (B Division Captain and Pitcher)</strong>
