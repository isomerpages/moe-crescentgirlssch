## **SOFTBALL**

&gt; "INDIVIDUAL PLAY THE GAME, BUT TEAMS BEAT THE ODDS"

The Crescent Softball team comprises of a group of promising and talented athletes who are under the guidance of National Team player Coach Liow Wan Yu and Pitching Coach Adelia Koh as well as the teachers-in-charge.

Through our rigorous training sessions twice to thrice a week (depending on the season), players have not only been able to improve their hard skills (for example: basic throwing/catching and batting skills) but also able to sharpen their soft skills such as teamwork. Softball training teaches our players the importance of values like determination, passion and communication, which are key in playing the game.

At the end of the year, our players are treated to an annual softball camp, which is an excellent opportunity for players to foster camaraderie and build team spirit and a sense of belonging. Through the activities and games, the members challenge and push themselves beyond their comfort zones and emerge a stronger and more formidable team.

We believe that as we continue to train hard, we will bring glory to Crescent.

Softball has taught me many life skills that can be used in my future endeavours such as perseverance, teamwork and sportsmanship. Training has helped me become not only physically, but mentally stronger. I have learnt that we should never give up even during tough situations and always strive to do our best. I am able to apply these skills on a day-to-day basis, shaping me into a better person. Overall, softball has helped me to improve my physical and mental performance. - **YEO JIN XUAN (C Division Vice captain and Catcher)**

Softball has taught me how to work well with others in a team as it is a team sport. Through many tough training sessions, I have also learnt many values such as resilience and responsibility, not giving up when facing challenges and playing my part to lead the team to success. - **WATT YU HENG JOCELYN** **(C Div Pitcher)**

Joining CGS softball is truly a decision I will never regret. For the rest of my life, I will hold near and dear to my heart the memories I have made with my team, the adrenaline pumping games and the valuable life lessons. Softball has taught me what it means to be an athlete, how to approach life with drive, passion, discipline, resilience and the never-ending thirst to strive for the best. It has truly been an honour to be captain of this team.- **ANGELINA CHANG XUE LING (B Division Captain and Pitcher)**
