<h2><strong>ENGLISH DRAMA</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our Best Act For You"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>English Drama is a vibrant Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) for Crescentian
theatre practitioners, aimed at equipping members with essential skills
to excel in drama. This includes training in scriptwriting, stagecraft,
and the entire play production process. Members learn foundational dramatic
techniques, such as using levels for effect, vocal projection, body language
awareness, facial expressions, and the nuances of lighting and sound. Every
participant is encouraged to explore and develop their unique talents,
fostering confidence in their abilities. Additionally, upper secondary
students receive training to take on roles as facilitators and leaders,
further enhancing their skills and preparing them for future challenges
in the arts.</p>
<p>English Drama actively participates in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival
Arts Presentation, where students collaborate with their instructors to
create a twenty-minute performance reflecting a specific societal aspect.
In this process, students have the chance to craft scripts, design props
and costumes, and arrange lighting. It is crucial to note that they take
on key roles like Stage Manager, allowing them to exercise autonomy over
their production. This hands-on experience serves as an excellent platform
for honing their leadership and organisational skills, fostering both personal
and artistic growth.</p>
<p>The English Drama members share a strong bond, organizing social events
that foster a familial atmosphere. It’s common to see alumni returning
to share their experiences, inspiring current members to reach new heights.
For students in the English Drama CCA at Crescent, their time spent here
is just the beginning of their journey into the Arts—it's an initiation
into a vibrant cultural lifestyle. This supportive community nurtures creativity
and passion, paving the way for lifelong connections and artistic exploration.</p>
