<h3><strong>ENGLISH DRAMA</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Our Best Act For You"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>English Drama is a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA) for Crescentian theatre
practitioners. The goal of the society is to ensure that every member is
equipped with the necessary skills to enable them to excel in drama. This
also involves the skills for scriptwriting, stagecraft as well as the play
production process. Members are taught the core basics of dramatic technique
– the use of levels to create effect, vocal projection, awareness of body
language, facial expressions, use of space and behind-the-scenes work on
lighting and sound. As such, every member is given the opportunity to develop
their talents and to discover their best talents to excel confidently.
Additionally, in the upper secondary levels, the students are trained to
take on responsibilities as facilitators and leaders.</p>
<p>English Drama also takes part in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival
Arts Presentation. For such performances, the students, in collaboration
with their instructors, discuss and devise a twenty-minute perspective
that provides reflection about a certain aspect of society. Students would
also have the opportunity to craft the scripts, create the props and costumes
as well as to arrange the lighting. Most importantly, it is the students
who assume roles such as the Stage Manager, that give them autonomy over
their production. This provides them with a good platform to hone their
leadership and organizational skills.</p>
<p>The English Drama members are close and organise social events to bond
as a family. It is common to see former students of the CCA returning to
share their experiences with the current members and to inspire their juniors
to new heights. The time the students spend in English Drama in Crescent
is only the beginning of their journey into the Arts – it is an initiation
into a cultural lifestyle.</p>

<p>Joining Crescent Drama has been a transformative journey of discovery.
Apart from refining my acting skills, it has helped reveal my true capabilities.
Every role I’ve embodied and every rehearsal I’ve participated in has significantly
shaped my confidence, creativity, and resilience. I am amazed at how I
am constantly pushed beyond my comfort zone, yet this heightens my sense
of accomplishment when I achieve things I never fathomed! You never truly
realize the depths of your potential until you step into the world of Crescent
Drama! <strong><em>- Isha Manoj (3S6), President of English Drama 2024/2025</em></strong>

<p>Drama is more than a CCA to me; it is a class, a home, a family. The values
I have learned during our sessions have shaped me and will stay with me,
guiding me through other aspects of my journey as a performer, a student,
and a person. I have learned the importance of clear communication and
will carry these lessons into the future. <strong><em>- Yeo Jia Chi (3S7), Vice-President of English Drama 2024/2025</em></strong>

<p>When I first stepped into Drama, I thought I knew exactly what to expect.
Having been a Drama student for four years in primary school, I felt a
surge of pride, ready to shine among the “amateurs.” However, I quickly
realized how wrong I was. My know-it-all attitude was promptly corrected
by the seniors—there are no "know-it-alls," only "learn-it-alls." That
moment humbled me, and I opened my mind to everything Drama had to teach.
But if I say more, I might spoil the adventure waiting for you. So, what
are you waiting for? Come join us and watch as we prepare our best act
for you! <strong><em>- Kripa Anna Thariyan (3S6), Vice-President of English Drama 2024/2025</em></strong>
