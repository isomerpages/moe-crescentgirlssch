<h2><strong>CHINESE AND MODERN DANCE</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To persevere till the end!”&nbsp; &nbsp;“<em>死也要拼出来</em> !”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crescent’s Chinese and Modern Dance is a warm and loving family. Crescent
dancers work towards a common goal of attaining excellence, and in the
process, stronger bonds are forged as we strive to overcome various obstacles
and challenges as a family.</p>
<p>Crescent Dance promotes dance as a form of art. A strong set of values
is instilled in each and every Crescent dancer as we embark on our journey.
In order to excel in what we are passionate about, Crescent dancers go
the extra mile to prepare ourselves for more than what is required of us
on stage. We stretch our limits to exceed expectations and realize that
there is more to dancing than simply executing our actions with perfection,
and we paint a story with our choreography.</p>
<p>“To persevere till the end” is the dance motto. With this, Crescent dancers
always strive to do our best, be it in dance or in our schoolwork.</p>
<p>In recent years, we were honoured to be invited to take part in various
national events, including the ASEAN Youth Games Opening Ceremony (2009),
National Day Parade (2009), Youth Olympic Games Opening Ceremony (2010),
ASEAN School Games (2012) and the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation
(2019, 2021, 2023, 2025). These concerts received resounding applause from
the audience.</p>
<p>Our various performances cover a wide range of dance genres such as Ballet,
Hip Hop, Chinese Dance, as well as special genres of dance, including lion
dance and dragon dance. Performances during school events, such as the
Secondary 1 Orientation Campfire, Chinese New Year, Speech Day, National
Day Celebrations as well as Teachers’ Day, provide us with extensive opportunities
to showcase our talents and also to share the joy of dancing with the rest
of the school population.</p>
<p>The Singapore Youth Festival is the pinnacle of all the dancers’ performances.
As the Chinese saying goes, “台上十分钟，台下十年工” In preparation for a single performance,
we practise for hours and dancing is a journey that requires much discipline
and perseverance, physically and mentally.</p>
<p>The extraordinary journey that each Crescent dancer experiences with the
Dance family is only made possible because we believe in caring for one
another and soaring to greater heights as one.</p>
<p>Crescent Dance is led by our Chinese &amp; Modern Dance Instructor, Ms
Maycia Teh Ruyan.</p>
