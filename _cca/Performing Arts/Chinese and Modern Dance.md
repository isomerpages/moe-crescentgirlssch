## **CHINESE AND MODERN DANCE**

&gt; “To persevere till the end!”&nbsp; &nbsp;“__死也要拼出来_ _!”

Crescent’s Chinese and Modern Dance is a warm and loving family. Crescent dancers work towards a common goal of attaining excellence, and in the process, stronger bonds are forged as we strive to overcome various obstacles and challenges as a family.

Crescent Dance promotes dance as a form of art. A strong set of values is instilled in each and every Crescent dancer as we embark on our journey. In order to excel in what we are passionate about, Crescent dancers go the extra mile to prepare ourselves for more than what is required of us on stage. We stretch our limits to exceed expectations and realize that there is more to dancing than simply executing our actions with perfection, and we paint a story with our choreography.

“To persevere till the end” is the dance motto. With this, Crescent dancers always strive to do our best, be it in dance or in our schoolwork.

In recent years, we were honoured to be invited to take part in various national events, including the ASEAN Youth Games Opening Ceremony (2009), National Day Parade (2009), Youth Olympic Games Opening Ceremony (2010), ASEAN School Games (2012) and the Singapore Youth Festival (2019, 2021, 2023). These concerts received resounding applause from the audience.

Our various performances cover a wide range of dance genres such as Ballet, Hip Hop, Chinese Dance, as well as special genres of dance, including lion dance and dragon dance. Performances during school events, such as the Secondary 1 Orientation Campfire, Chinese New Year, Speech Day, National Day Celebrations as well as Teachers’ Day, provide us with extensive opportunities to showcase our talents and also to share the joy of dancing with the rest of the school population.

The Singapore Youth Festival is the pinnacle of all the dancers’ performances. As the Chinese saying goes, “台上十分钟，台下十年工” In preparation for a single performance, we practise for hours and dancing is a journey that requires much discipline and perseverance, physically and mentally.

The extraordinary journey that each Crescent dancer experiences with the Dance family is only made possible because we believe in caring for one another and soaring to greater heights as one.

“Crescent Dance is a place where we can learn how to not only care for ourselves, but also how to take care and be considerate of others. Our Dance teachers never fail to help us grow, by teaching us the importance of many values, some of which include teamwork and discipline. Discipline is a greatly treasured value in dance, as discipline is what gets us through the toughest of dance practices, and the most tiring of dances.” **- Tang Ho Yan, Isabelle**

“Diversity is at the heart of Crescent Dance, as we explore an array of dance genres, from Chinese dance, urban street dance, and even lion dance! Dancers can also try their hand at choreography where they are given artistic freedom which fosters their creativity. By the time dancers step down in Secondary 4, they will be versatile dancers who are well-versed in an array of genres and enriched with invaluable experiences. In Crescent Dance, you don't just dance; you grow, evolve, and thrive as both a dancer and an individual.” ***- Keira Lee***

“Dance has impacted my life in every way possible. With the many dance genres that we are exposed to, I was able to expand my potential and gain inspiration from others around me. I am thankful to this CCA for allowing me to understand myself better and allowing me to be a better dancer and person. Through Dance, I gained a renewed perspective on life, forged strong friendships that I will hold on to and a loving community that will be in my heart even as we leave the CCA one day.” ***- Quek En Ting***

“Crescent Dance is a place of comfort. During Dance sessions, there is no judgement, as long as you dance with your heart and with passion. Every dancer is a leader in their own way. Growing takes time, and after 3 years in Dance, I have grown in many ways. I will never trade my time in Crescent Dance with anything else because the times spent dancing shaped me to the person I am today.” ***- Janelle Soh***
