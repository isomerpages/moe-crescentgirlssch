<h2><strong>CHINESE AND MODERN DANCE</strong></h2>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To persevere till the end!”&nbsp; &nbsp;“<em>死也要拼出来</em> !”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crescent’s Chinese and Modern Dance is a warm and loving family. Crescent
dancers work towards a common goal of attaining excellence, and in the
process, stronger bonds are forged as we strive to overcome various obstacles
and challenges as a family.</p>
<p>Crescent Dance promotes dance as a form of art. A strong set of values
is instilled in each and every Crescent dancer as we embark on our journey.
In order to excel in what we are passionate about, Crescent dancers go
the extra mile to prepare ourselves for more than what is required of us
on stage. We stretch our limits to exceed expectations and realize that
there is more to dancing than simply executing our actions with perfection,
and we paint a story with our choreography.</p>
<p>“To persevere till the end” is the dance motto. With this, Crescent dancers
always strive to do our best, be it in dance or in our schoolwork.</p>
<p>In recent years, we were honoured to be invited to take part in various
national events, including the ASEAN Youth Games Opening Ceremony (2009),
National Day Parade (2009), Youth Olympic Games Opening Ceremony (2010),
ASEAN School Games (2012) and the Singapore Youth Festival (2019, 2021,
2023). These concerts received resounding applause from the audience.</p>
<p>Our various performances cover a wide range of dance genres such as Ballet,
Hip Hop, Chinese Dance, as well as special genres of dance, including lion
dance and dragon dance. Performances during school events, such as the
Secondary 1 Orientation Campfire, Chinese New Year, Speech Day, National
Day Celebrations as well as Teachers’ Day, provide us with extensive opportunities
to showcase our talents and also to share the joy of dancing with the rest
of the school population.</p>
<p>The Singapore Youth Festival is the pinnacle of all the dancers’ performances.
As the Chinese saying goes, “台上十分钟，台下十年工” In preparation for a single performance,
we practise for hours and dancing is a journey that requires much discipline
and perseverance, physically and mentally.</p>
<p>The extraordinary journey that each Crescent dancer experiences with the
Dance family is only made possible because we believe in caring for one
another and soaring to greater heights as one.</p>
<p><em>Crescent Dance is led by our Chinese Dance Instructor, Ms Lee Bee Choo, Modern Dance Instructor, Mr Low Ee Chiang.</em>

<p>“Crescent Dance is a place where we can learn how to not only care for
ourselves, but also how to take care and be considerate of others. Our
Dance teachers never fail to help us grow, by teaching us the importance
of many values, some of which include teamwork and discipline. Discipline
is a greatly treasured value in dance, as discipline is what gets us through
the toughest of dance practices, and the most tiring of dances.” <strong>- Tang Ho Yan, Isabelle</strong>
</p>
<p>“Diversity is at the heart of Crescent Dance, as we explore an array of
dance genres, from Chinese dance, urban street dance, and even lion dance!
Dancers can also try their hand at choreography where they are given artistic
freedom which fosters their creativity. By the time dancers step down in
Secondary 4, they will be versatile dancers who are well-versed in an array
of genres and enriched with invaluable experiences. In Crescent Dance,
you don't just dance; you grow, evolve, and thrive as both a dancer and
an individual.” <strong><em>- Keira Lee</em></strong>
</p>
<p>“Dance has impacted my life in every way possible. With the many dance
genres that we are exposed to, I was able to expand my potential and gain
inspiration from others around me. I am thankful to this CCA for allowing
me to understand myself better and allowing me to be a better dancer and
person. Through Dance, I gained a renewed perspective on life, forged strong
friendships that I will hold on to and a loving community that will be
in my heart even as we leave the CCA one day.” <strong><em>- Quek En Ting</em></strong>
</p>
<p>“Crescent Dance is a place of comfort. During Dance sessions, there is
no judgement, as long as you dance with your heart and with passion. Every
dancer is a leader in their own way. Growing takes time, and after 3 years
in Dance, I have grown in many ways. I will never trade my time in Crescent
Dance with anything else because the times spent dancing shaped me to the
person I am today.” <strong><em>- Janelle Soh</em></strong>
