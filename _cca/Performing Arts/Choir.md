<h2><strong>CHOIR</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“We Sing as One!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Crescent Girls’ School Choir or more affectionately known as CrezChorale
has been actively contributing to the musical culture in school, and has
been regularly participating in public performances as well. The choir
received the Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival
Arts Presentation in 2017, 2019, 2023, and 2025. The choir was also proud
to attain the Gold Award at the Singapore International Choral Festival
(SICF) in 2018, scoring the highest mark among the Singapore choirs in
its category.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With their motto, ‘The Voice, The Spirit, The Soul’, the choir shows commitment
and passion in both performing and mentoring younger singers. Recent significant
events that the choir participated in include their very own full concert,
Prismatic which was thoroughly subscribed, and singing for President Tharman
Shanmugaratnam and many dignitaries in an event hosted by NeuGen, an organisation
that focuses on giving support and fresh starts to offenders, ex-offenders,
and their families. The choir also participates in numerous inter-school
choir exchanges with various secondary school and Junior College choirs
and performs for the school during special occasions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In an effort to promote lifelong, continuous learning and societal relevance,
the choir takes a holistic approach towards musical education which encourages
personal and others-centric growth. The choir is guided with peer-led activities,
creative problem-solving, dialogue and discourse between students, teachers,
and instructors, and opportunities to not just sing for themselves, but
to also give back to the society.</p>
