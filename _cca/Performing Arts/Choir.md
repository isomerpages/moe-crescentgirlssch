<h3><strong>CHOIR</strong></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“We Sing as One!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Crescent Girls’ School Choir or more affectionately known as CrezChorale
has been actively contributing to the musical culture in school, and has
been regularly participating in public performances as well. The choir
received the Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival
Arts Presentation in 2017, 2019, 2023, and 2025. The choir was also proud
to attain the Gold Award at the Singapore International Choral Festival
(SICF) in 2018, scoring the highest mark among the Singapore choirs in
its category.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With their motto, ‘The Voice, The Spirit, The Soul’, the choir shows commitment
and passion in both performing and mentoring younger singers. Recent significant
events that the choir participated in include their very own full concert,
Prismatic which was thoroughly subscribed, and singing for President Tharman
Shanmugaratnam and many dignitaries in an event hosted by NeuGen, an organisation
that focuses on giving support and fresh starts to offenders, ex-offenders,
and their families. The choir also participates in numerous inter-school
choir exchanges with various secondary school and Junior College choirs
and performs for the school during special occasions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In an effort to promote lifelong, continuous learning and societal relevance,
the choir takes a holistic approach towards musical education which encourages
personal and others-centric growth. The choir is guided with peer-led activities,
creative problem-solving, dialogue and discourse between students, teachers,
and instructors, and opportunities to not just sing for themselves, but
to also give back to the society.</p>

<p>I really enjoy choir as it is a supportive environment where I grew a
lot, not only in my singing, but also in my confidence and passion for
music. Being in the choir also taught me the importance of team spirit
and discipline, especially during the SYF season. ~ <strong><em>Pang Ren Jun (1S6) - Soprano 1</em></strong>

<p>I love choir, it’s very enjoyable! My seniors and other choir members
are so nice to me and are really helpful. I have really close friends who
are in choir and my juniors are also pretty funny and easy to get along
with. Choir bonding is also fun whenever it comes up we get to do karaoke
and play games as a choir. The songs we sing are unique as well!&nbsp;&nbsp;~ <strong><em>Ankita Chinchwade (2C3) - Alto 1</em></strong>

<p>Not only has choir helped me to improve my vocal skills, it has also allowed
me to learn how to work in groups. Whether it’s theory lessons or combines,
choir is always fun! ~ <strong><em>Valerie Yeo Xin Yu (3C3) - Alto 2</em></strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Being part of the choir has helped me grow into a responsible and adaptable
individual. It’s a wonderful platform where people from all walks of life
come together to share their love for music, singing in harmony as one.
Through this, I’ve experienced a strong sense of camaraderie and teamwork,
creating a warm, positive, and truly uplifting environment that I’m grateful
to be part of! ~<strong><em>Sundara Raman Oviya&nbsp;&nbsp;(3G4) - 2025/2026 exco</em></strong>
