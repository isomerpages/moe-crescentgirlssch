<p>‚ÄúBeing a part of choir allowed me to experience working with different
people, as all of us come from different backgrounds and have different
strengths. As a leader, I learned that it is important to earn the trust
of each choir member in order to work well with them. Choir has a supportive
and open environment where even the instructors are friendly and open to
new ideas.‚Äù <strong><em>Lo Yi Xuan Claire (3C2) - President</em></strong>
</p>
<p>‚ÄúI enjoy being with the people in choir as they are very fun, and we also
sing many different genres of music.&nbsp; We also have choir bonding sessions
where we get to know other choristers in our section and cohort better,
especially during the karaoke segment. Performing on stage, going for concerts,
and participating in choir exchanges with other schools make for a really
enriching experience!‚Äù <strong><em>Charissa Liang Hui En (1S2) &amp; Andrea Ong Joh Sim (1S2) - Alto 1</em></strong>
</p>
<p>‚ÄúChoir helped me grow as a person. Being in Choir enables us to develop
a sense of teamwork and discipline that help us perform more efficiently
as a group.‚Äù <strong><em>Ng Ye Shuen (3G2) - Soprano 1</em></strong>
</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy experience in Choir is fulfilling to say the least! We get to learn
how to sing well, and also experience singing in various languages. I made
many friends in Choir, and they make my school life more fun! üòÄ" <strong><em>Isabel Kang Ting Xuan (2S2) - Alto 2</em></strong>
</p>
<p>‚ÄúCrezChorale is a hodgepodge of different talents who come together, with
the common goal of making music through singing. More importantly, we are
a CrAzYü§™ family who go through life together through thick and thin, rise
to challenges, and grow past them! We sing as one!‚Äù <strong><em>Mr. Keane Ong (Instructor/Conductor)</em></strong>
