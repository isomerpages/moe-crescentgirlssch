‚ÄúBeing a part of choir allowed me to experience working with different people, as all of us come from different backgrounds and have different strengths. As a leader, I learned that it is important to earn the trust of each choir member in order to work well with them. Choir has a supportive and open environment where even the instructors are friendly and open to new ideas.‚Äù **_Lo Yi Xuan Claire (3C2) - President_**

‚ÄúI enjoy being with the people in choir as they are very fun, and we also sing many different genres of music.&nbsp; We also have choir bonding sessions where we get to know other choristers in our section and cohort better, especially during the karaoke segment. Performing on stage, going for concerts, and participating in choir exchanges with other schools make for a really enriching experience!‚Äù **_Charissa Liang Hui En (1S2) &amp; Andrea Ong Joh Sim (1S2) - Alto 1_**
