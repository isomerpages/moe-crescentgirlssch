<h2><strong>CHOIR</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúWe Sing as One!‚Äù</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Crescent Girls‚Äô School Choir or more affectionately known as CrezChorale
has been actively contributing to the musical culture in school, and has
been regularly participating in public performances as well. The choir
received the Certificate of Distinction at the Singapore Youth Festival
Arts Presentation in 2017, 2019, 2023, and 2025. The choir was also proud
to attain the Gold Award at the Singapore International Choral Festival
(SICF) in 2018, scoring the highest mark among the Singapore choirs in
its category.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With their motto, ‚ÄòThe Voice, The Spirit, The Soul‚Äô, the choir shows commitment
and passion in both performing and mentoring younger singers. Recent significant
events that the choir participated in include their very own full concert,
Prismatic which was thoroughly subscribed, and singing for President Tharman
Shanmugaratnam and many dignitaries in an event hosted by NeuGen, an organisation
that focuses on giving support and fresh starts to offenders, ex-offenders,
and their families. The choir also participates in numerous inter-school
choir exchanges with various secondary school and Junior College choirs
and performs for the school during special occasions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In an effort to promote lifelong, continuous learning and societal relevance,
the choir takes a holistic approach towards musical education which encourages
personal and others-centric growth. The choir is guided with peer-led activities,
creative problem-solving, dialogue and discourse between students, teachers,
and instructors, and opportunities to not just sing for themselves, but
to also give back to the society.</p>

<p>‚ÄúBeing a part of choir allowed me to experience working with different
people, as all of us come from different backgrounds and have different
strengths. As a leader, I learned that it is important to earn the trust
of each choir member in order to work well with them. Choir has a supportive
and open environment where even the instructors are friendly and open to
new ideas.‚Äù <strong><em>Lo Yi Xuan Claire (3C2) - President</em></strong>
</p>
<p>‚ÄúI enjoy being with the people in choir as they are very fun, and we also
sing many different genres of music.&nbsp; We also have choir bonding sessions
where we get to know other choristers in our section and cohort better,
especially during the karaoke segment. Performing on stage, going for concerts,
and participating in choir exchanges with other schools make for a really
enriching experience!‚Äù <strong><em>Charissa Liang Hui En (1S2) &amp; Andrea Ong Joh Sim (1S2) - Alto 1</em></strong>
</p>
<p>‚ÄúChoir helped me grow as a person. Being in Choir enables us to develop
a sense of teamwork and discipline that help us perform more efficiently
as a group.‚Äù <strong><em>Ng Ye Shuen (3G2) - Soprano 1</em></strong>
</p>
<p>‚ÄúMy experience in Choir is fulfilling to say the least! We get to learn
how to sing well, and also experience singing in various languages. I made
many friends in Choir, and they make my school life more fun! üòÄ" <strong><em>Isabel Kang Ting Xuan (2S2) - Alto 2</em></strong>
</p>
<p>‚ÄúCrezChorale is a hodgepodge of different talents who come together, with
the common goal of making music through singing. More importantly, we are
a CrAzYü§™ family who go through life together through thick and thin, rise
to challenges, and grow past them! We sing as one!‚Äù <strong><em>Mr. Keane Ong (Instructor/Conductor)</em></strong>
