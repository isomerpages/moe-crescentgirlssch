## **SYMPHONIC BAND**

&gt; "ET BIENTOT LE MEILLEUR - THE BEST IS YET TO BE."

Established in 1967 as a military school band, Crescent Girls’ School Symphonic Band has since then, expanded to become a symphonic band with a wide range of instruments, under the steadfast guidance of Mdm Tan Soh Hwa, Mr Chua Tiong Hong and Mr Patrick Neo. With the band motto, Et bientot le meilleur — the best is yet to be, in mind, members of Crescent Girls’ School Symphonic Band have never failed to put in their best efforts to constantly improve their skills and techniques – never giving up nor holding back, but are always working together as one band to achieve their goals.

Under the guidance of the conductors, the band put on numerous performances both internally and at venues such as Esplanade for Limelight. While it has certainly not been an easy journey, Band members have shown their determination and perseverance in striving for betterment of their performances. Under the mentorship of Ms Low Geok Pin and the supervision of teachers-in-charge, Mdm Norzaidah Suparman, Ms Rafiqqa Binte Mustapha, and from 2023, Ms Jacqueline Chen Wei Wen and Ms Lim Yin Xia, Crescent Girls’ School Symphonic Band has established itself as a fine band that never stops pursuing excellence

“The experiences that I went through in Band certainly has helped me improve as a person and Band player. The past 2.5 years in Band allowed me to form many precious memories with my bandmates and the journey with them so far, has been a very memorable one. The process of learning new pieces and fine-tuning them to the smallest detail is tiring, but the rewards that are gained after a performance is worth it.”&nbsp;**- Cayley Wong Jing Yi (3G1)**

“I’m thankful for the opportunities the Band has to offer. The journey of playing and fine-tuning our instruments with our bandmates allows us to create many memories. Performing on stage is an exciting and rewarding experience that I hope others can enjoy as well!” **- Jovin Cheong Lee Ann(3C2)**

“Being a part of Band not only allowed me to appreciate music and improve my playing, it has also taught me valuable life lessons. Despite the tough hours of practice during CCA, I learned to listen, adjust, and adapt to others. There is nothing compared to the satisfaction felt when the Band comes together to create one harmonious sound. As I continue to evolve, I carry with me the meaningful lessons learned, forever grateful for the profound impact it has had on shaping who I am today.” **- Danielle Lim Zhi Ling (3S2)**
