## **SYMPHONIC BAND**

>*"ET BIENTOT LE MEILLEUR - THE BEST IS YET TO BE."*

Established in 1967 as a military school band, Crescent Girls’ School Symphonic Band has since then expanded to become a symphonic band with a wide range of instruments, under the steadfast guidance of the band’s founder, Mr Lee Seck Chiang, and his protégés Mdm Tan Soh Hwa and Mr Chua Tiong Hong. With the band motto, Et bientot le meilleur — the best is yet to be, in mind, the members of Crescent Girls’ School Symphonic Band never fail to put in their best efforts to constantly improve their skills and techniques, where they never give up, never hold back, and are always working together as one band to achieve their goals.

Under the guidance of the conductors, the band has put up numerous performances at venues such as Esplanade for Limelight. Despite the recent restrictions put in place due to the current Covid-19 pandemic, the band members have continued to show their determination and love for band by working around these obstacles to have e-CCA training sessions on Zoom. While it has certainly not been an easy journey, Band has shown their determination and perseverance in striving for betterment despite challenges. With the mentorship of Ms Low Geok Pin and the supervision of teachers-in-charge, Mdm Norzaidah Suparman, Ms Rafiqqa Binte Mustapha, Ms Brenda Boey and Ms Tan Chin Yee, Crescent Girls’ School Symphonic Band has established itself as a fine band that never stops pursuing excellence.

"Band is like a family to me because we share a close bond with one another, making band fun and warm. To me, the band is not just a CCA, it is like a home that allows us to learn many new things and many life values. We learn how to play good music together as one band, and at the same time possessing a high level of discipline and responsibility too. I believe these life values and the lessons we learn through each and every experience will guide us along with our life, our journey."
***- Nicole Tang Rui Qi (3G3) about her opinions on the band.***

"Band is a great addition to my secondary school life. It has taught me countless things and I can't imagine how plain and boring my secondary school life would have been without the band. Sometimes when I look at the other CCAs, I would wonder how different my life would have been if I was in another CCA. We have gone through all the good and bad times together as a band and we have never given up because we love the band. I have slowly realized how the band is like a family to me, something I greatly cherish. Something that I will never regret in my life, and the best decision I've ever made, is ticking the option to join the band. It has turned out to be the greatest gift I have gotten from Crescent, an experience that can't be explained with words. I will give the band whatever I have in return for what it has given me."
***- Leong Shi Yin Vanessa (3C2) about her thoughts and experiences in the band.***

"Being a part of the Crescent Symphonic Band has shaped me into a leader of courage, and a person of character. To summarise my band experience in 50 words is simply making an understatement. In the 3 1/3 years I have never learned as much as I did anywhere else, and what I have gained from this journey is priceless. Not only have I learned values and skills, but I have also learned many life lessons. I fell in love with the people and the art, and I have never felt more blessed to be anywhere else. The band was a journey, an experience, the family I never had, for which I will never forget."
