<h2><strong>SYMPHONIC BAND</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>ET BIENTOT LE MEILLEUR - THE BEST IS YET TO BE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Established in 1967 as a military school band, Crescent Girls’ School
Symphonic Band has since then, expanded to become a symphonic band with
a wide range of instruments, under the steadfast guidance of Mdm Tan Soh
Hwa, Mr Chua Tiong Hong and Mr Patrick Neo. With the band motto, Et bientot
le meilleur — the best is yet to be, in mind, members of Crescent Girls’
School Symphonic Band have never failed to put in their best efforts to
constantly improve their skills and techniques – never giving up nor holding
back, but are always working together as one band to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the conductors, the band put on numerous performances
both internally and at venues such as Esplanade for Limelight. While it
has certainly not been an easy journey, Band members have shown their determination
and perseverance in striving for betterment of their performances.</p>
