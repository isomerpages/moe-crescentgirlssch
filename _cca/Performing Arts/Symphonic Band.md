<h2><strong>SYMPHONIC BAND</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>ET BIENTOT LE MEILLEUR - THE BEST IS YET TO BE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Established in 1967 as a military school band, Crescent Girls’ School
Symphonic Band has since then, expanded to become a symphonic band with
a wide range of instruments, under the steadfast guidance of Mdm Tan Soh
Hwa, Mr Chua Tiong Hong and Mr Patrick Neo. With the band motto, Et bientot
le meilleur — the best is yet to be, in mind, members of Crescent Girls’
School Symphonic Band have never failed to put in their best efforts to
constantly improve their skills and techniques – never giving up nor holding
back, but are always working together as one band to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the conductors, the band put on numerous performances
both internally and at venues such as Esplanade for Limelight. While it
has certainly not been an easy journey, Band members have shown their determination
and perseverance in striving for betterment of their performances.</p>

<p>“Being in band has risen me up to be a better player and a better person
at heart. Not only do we learn music, but we also learn to face our challenges
head on and solve them. The atmosphere in CGSSB has also been very friendly
and nurturing, where my seniors are always there to guide me every step
of the way. Furthermore, the thought of making music with my instrument
brings me immense joy and excitement. In CGSSB, our instructors come up
with fun and exhilarating ways to get us to improve on our skills and techniques
while always surprising us with the coolest scores to play. No matter how
difficult the piece may be, I have never failed to enjoy this experience
in CGSSB!”</p>

<p>“Being in CGSSB has given me the opportunity to discover and pursue my
passion in music. Music has since become an important part in my life.
Not only that, I am also able to make many memories with people whom I
hope to call my lifelong friends in CGSSB. Despite having long practice
hours, the satisfaction of performing makes it worth it. With encouragement
and support from teachers and instructors, we can learn how to strive for
our best and to persevere through all the challenges. As I progress further
into life, I will cherish these memories and lessons that I’ve made and
will forever be grateful for being a part of CGSSB.”</p>

<p>“Music has always been a big part of my life. I always strive to gain
opportunities to help me understand music better. CGSSB has allowed me
the opportunities to express myself as a musician and artist through music.
CGSSB has made me understand different types of music, and I hope that
one day I would be able to analyse them. Furthermore, CGSSB has taught
me many good moral values such as responsibility and respect. These, I
believe will help me a lot in the future. I feel that in CGSSB, I can fully
express myself during the practices and strive to be better.”</p>

<p>“Being a part of Band not only allowed me to appreciate music and improve
my playing, it has also taught me valuable life lessons. Despite the tough
hours of practice during CCA, I learned to listen, adjust, and adapt to
others. There is nothing compared to the satisfaction felt when the Band
comes together to create one harmonious sound. As I continue to evolve,
I carry with me the meaningful lessons learned, forever grateful for the
profound impact it has had on shaping who I am today.”</p>
