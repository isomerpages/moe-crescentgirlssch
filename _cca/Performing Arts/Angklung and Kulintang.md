## **ANGKLUNG AND KULINTANG**

&gt; "We shake the world!"

Crescent’s Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble, also known as C.A.K.E., is more than just a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). We have always been told about the importance of being united as an ensemble to achieve great feats. Through the various performances we took part in, we have formed greater bonds with each other.&nbsp;

Additionally, having teamwork is critical to enable us to achieve a common goal. With this in mind, we participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and attained the Certificate of Distinction in 2021 and Certificate of Achievement in 2023. It was one of our proudest moments as an ensemble when we achieved this award. We look forward to many more wonderful years ahead as a family.

"Being in Angklung for the past few years, enabled me to learn that true mastery of an instrument transcends beyond mere techniques and skills. It is a symphony of determination, boundless passion, and above all, the harmonious unity that emerges when playing in an ensemble." **- Dhakshayani, 3C1**

"My experience in Angklung taught me that we need to have two crucial things in order to succeed in the CCA, and they are teamwork and passion. When one person plays an Angklung, it is just an ordinary sound. However, when a whole ensemble plays their instruments together, beautiful music is created. Furthermore, when we enjoy playing our music, it creates a wonderful musical experience for us and for the people listening to our music." **- Nur Safiyah, 3G2**

"Being in Angklung enabled me to learn how to cooperate with my CCA mates and how to be patient. Angklung is not just about knowing when YOU should play your instrument, it is also about hearing and listening to others. As a team, every instrument is critical and therefore, everyone’s role is important." **- Tanishka, 2C1**

“Being in Angklung made me realize that while we should work to develop and improve ourselves, we also need to help others to help them improve too. This is because what is the point of being a team if there is only one person playing? I have always loved music, and Angklung has not only helped me develop that love, but also allowed me to appreciate the significance and beauty of this wonderful instrument.” **- Lauren, 3G3**
