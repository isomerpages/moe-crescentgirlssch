## **ANGKLUNG AND KULINTANG**

>*"We shake the world!"*

Crescent’s Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble, also known as C.A.K.E., is more than just a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). We have always been told about the importance of being united as an ensemble in order to achieve great feats. Through the various performances we have taken part in, we have definitely formed greater bonds with each other. 

Additionally, having teamwork is critical to enable us to achieve a common goal. With this in mind, we participated in the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) and attained the Certificate of Distinction in 2021. It was one of our proudest moments as an ensemble when we achieved this award. We look forward to many more wonderful years ahead as a family.

"Being in Angklung for the past few years, I've learnt that the best way for one to actually play music well is to have the passion and also feel the music and enjoy what we are playing. It is not only about remembering your own parts but also everyone playing their part and putting in their effort in order to produce good music."  
***- Rena Chong (3S1) on lessons she has learnt after joining Angklung***

"Joining Angklung has made me learn the importance of teamwork. Every single one of us is important to the production of beautiful music for the audience to enjoy. Not only that, we must also be able enjoy ourselves in the process, and not to find it mundane or the performance would not be a successful one."
***- Valerie Chan (3C2) on what she has learnt from joining this ensemble***

***- Dionne Pok (3G2) on how joining Angklung has changed her perspective***

“Passion is one key driving factor because with passion, we will go all out to achieve what we set out as an ensemble. The most important thing is to work together, put in our best and be confident. That is the greatest form of satisfaction.”
