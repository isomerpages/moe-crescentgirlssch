<h2><strong>ANGKLUNG AND KULINTANG</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>"We shake the world!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crescent’s Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble, also known as C.A.K.E., is
more than just a Co-Curricular Activity (CCA). We have always been told
about the importance of being united as an ensemble to achieve great feats.
Through the various performances we took part in, we have formed greater
bonds with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, having teamwork is critical to enable us to achieve a common
goal. With this in mind, we participated in the Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) and attained the Certificate of Distinction in 2021 and Certificate
of Achievement in 2023. It was one of our proudest moments as an ensemble
when we achieved this award. We look forward to many more wonderful years
ahead as a family.</p>

<p>"Being in Angklung for the past few years, enabled me to learn that true
mastery of an instrument transcends beyond mere techniques and skills.
It is a symphony of determination, boundless passion, and above all, the
harmonious unity that emerges when playing in an ensemble." <strong>- Dhakshayani, 3C1</strong>
</p>
<p>"My experience in Angklung taught me that we need to have two crucial
things in order to succeed in the CCA, and they are teamwork and passion.
When one person plays an Angklung, it is just an ordinary sound. However,
when a whole ensemble plays their instruments together, beautiful music
is created. Furthermore, when we enjoy playing our music, it creates a
wonderful musical experience for us and for the people listening to our
music." <strong>- Nur Safiyah, 3G2</strong>
</p>
<p>"Being in Angklung enabled me to learn how to cooperate with my CCA mates
and how to be patient. Angklung is not just about knowing when YOU should
play your instrument, it is also about hearing and listening to others.
As a team, every instrument is critical and therefore, everyone’s role
is important." <strong>- Tanishka, 2C1</strong>
</p>
<p>“Being in Angklung made me realize that while we should work to develop
and improve ourselves, we also need to help others to help them improve
too. This is because what is the point of being a team if there is only
one person playing? I have always loved music, and Angklung has not only
helped me develop that love, but also allowed me to appreciate the significance
and beauty of this wonderful instrument.” <strong>- Lauren, 3G3</strong>
