<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crescent Girls’ School would like to warmly welcome you to our Crescentian
family. The Secondary One Registration Exercise marks the start of your
daughter’s/ward’s journey at Crescent. We look forward to building a strong
partnership with you to support your daughter/ward as she develops into
a lady and leader.</p>
<p>Please access your Parents Gateway account for links to the registration
form and online videos from 1pm onwards. Students who are eligible for
Higher Mother Tongue will also receive the option form through Parents’
Gateway. Students from Posting Group 2 who are eligible to take subjects
at a More Demanding Level (G3) will also receive the option form through
Parents’ Gateway. Parents without Parents Gateway are required to access
the document ‘Parents Gateway User Guide’ for information on going on board
Parents Gateway.</p>
<p>We have also made available the relevant resources which will be helpful
to your daughter in getting ready for the new school year.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
