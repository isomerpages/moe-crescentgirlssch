<h4><strong>Limelight @ Esplanade 2024</strong></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Limelight @ Esplanade 2024, which took place on 6 February at the Esplanade
Concert Hall, was certainly an enriching experience, as we got to see months
of hard work and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">determination</a> paid
off. The opportunity to play in such a prestigious concert hall has fuelled
us to ensure we put on our best performance, enduring grueling and rigorous
rehearsals as we perfected pieces like Coldplay Classics and Merry-Go-Round
of Life. This was also a wonderful experience as we bonded with our section
mates and thoroughly enjoyed each other’s company and encouragement. During
the concert, the loud cheers and responses from the audience after each
musical piece served as an indication that we had performed well and it
left a sense of accomplishment in all our hearts.</p>
