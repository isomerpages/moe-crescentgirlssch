<h3>Total Defence Day 2024</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The year 2024 marks 40 years of Total Defence in Singapore. On 15 February,
Crescent held several events to commemorate Total Defence Day. For instance,
we participated in a power disruption exercise, where all energy sources
were switched off throughout the school for two whole hours. Sitting through
the stifling heat with the rest of my classmates made me truly realize
how critical it is to be prepared and ready for all disruptions. We also
had level-wide competitions, where classes produced interesting and educational
commercials based on the six different Total Defence pillars. The creation
process allowed Crescentians to learn more about the different pillars
beyond what was already being taught in classrooms, as well as to develop
an appreciation for Singapore’s defence. The CrezCommunity Leaders also
put together an informative concert for us to deepen our understanding
on Singapore’s national security. Thanks to these activities, I became
more aware of my role in contributing to Singapore’s collective security
and prosperity.&nbsp;</p>
