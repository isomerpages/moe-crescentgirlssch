<h4>Chinese New Year Celebration</h4>
<p>Every year, the Chinese New Year celebration in Crescent is an event anticipated
by both staff and students! This year’s celebrations, held on 9 February,
started off with an extended recess; with the generous donations of the
PSG, we were provided with opportunities to try out an array of traditional
snacks and desserts, such as Bee Hives, Love Letters, and Prawn Rolls.
After recess, we went back to our classrooms for a class bonding session
where students played games and other interesting activities. I had a lot
of fun laughing with my friends!</p>
<p>The highlight of the event was the concert held in the hall. We enjoyed
listening to tunes like<strong> '恭喜恭喜’ </strong>and <strong>"Viva La Vida"</strong> by
Coldplay, performed by our very own Anklung and Kulitang group; I especially
liked the percussive and mellow tones made by the different instruments.
Not to be outdone by the other performances, members of the CGS Dance showcased
a spectacular and lively lion and dragon dance. The dancers were graceful
and fluid in their movements, and every single one of them was in sync!</p>
<p>This year's CNY celebration in Crescent was a new experience for me and
I had so much fun with my friends! This event will surely be cherished
by many Crescentians during their four-year journey in Crescent!</p>
