<p>16 January 2024 marked a significant event in Crescent’s calendar - The
Dedication Ceremony, a meaningful event in which both staff and students
pledge their dedication and love to the Crescentian Family as well as to
welcome new members into the Crescentian family.</p>
<p>As Mrs Chong introduced each and every staff member (both teaching and
non-teaching) from the various departments, the students cheered enthusiastically,
showing their appreciation to their teachers, all of whom played a significant
role in moulding them through their years in Crescent. This was followed
by the teacher’s pledge led by our Principal, Mrs Helen Chong.</p>
<p>To mark this special initiation of our Secondary One Crescentians, our
Secondary Four students pinned the badges for the Secondary Ones and gave
them a special note of encouragement to motivate them to always strive
for excellence and to not give up even when the going gets tough. Finally,
Crescentians recited the student’s pledge led by Student Council President,
Saanvi Reddy, to renew our commitment to the school to not only uphold
the school values of courtesy, generosity, and sincerity but to also become
ladies and leaders of tomorrow.</p>
<p>The ceremony ended off with the school cheer and everyone left the auditorium
with a newfound sense of pride and longing to make Crescent proud.</p>
