<h2>Orientation Campfire 2024</h2>
<p>A word to describe Crescent's annual Orientation Campfire: Dazzling. This
year's theme, inspired by Dr Seuss, "Oh, The Places You'll Go", is aimed
at encouraging the Secondary 1 students as they enter a new and different
environment.</p>
<p>The fireball drop, which was also the highlight of the campfire, signaled
the start of the campfire as students cheered despite the gloomy clouds
in the sky. Following this, the students were treated to performances put
up by the Symphonic Band, Red Cross Youth, National Cadet Corps, Dance,
Angklung and Kulintang, Choir, and a finale zesty dance by the Girl Guides.
Despite the inclement weather, the campfire was still a success, with students
jamming to the performances and having fun playing the games.</p>
