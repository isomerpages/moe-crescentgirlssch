<h3><strong>Inspiring Journeys to Success</strong></h3>
<p><em>After the release of the 2023 ‘O’ level results, the CGS Corporate Communications Committee had the opportunity to interview some of the Character Edusave Awardees to provide some insights into their experience in preparing for the O Levels.</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>Can you describe your journey to success in preparing for the ‘O’ Levels? Were there any specific challenges you faced, and how did you overcome them? </em></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Xin Hui: </strong>Preparing for O Levels was a tiring but worthwhile
journey. On several days, I had to sacrifice my rest and leisure time just
to complete my notes and assignments after a long day of school. However,
I was&nbsp;able to study together with my friends and had the support of
my teachers at all times which made my journey a less painful one. One
of the biggest challenges I faced during my preparations was dealing with
exam stress. I always had the thought that I was not sufficiently prepared
for all my exams which made me super anxious. To deal with this, I had
my friends recall the important points with me before the exam and tested
each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What strategies or techniques did you adopt to maintain your motivation and focus during the preparation period leading up to the O levels?"</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Joanne</strong>: I believe that having a healthy body and mind
are important, and striking a good balance has helped me remain focused
throughout the O level period. Each week, I would set aside some time to
exercise and build my physical health, taking the chance to mentally reset
such that I do not feel burned out. This helped to keep me motivated and
focused during my study sessions as I was not overwhelmed by constant revision.
Maintaining my mental well-being and physical health was essential in enabling
me to perform at my best during the exams without feeling too drained.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>As an Edusave Character Awardee, you have demonstrated the school values of courage, resilience, drive for excellence, innovativeness, empathy, and teamwork. How have these values influenced you in your Upper Secondary school days? Can you provide specific examples? &nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Stacie: </strong>These values made me more emotionally mature,
allowing me to handle various situations with more composure and make good
decisions. For example, courage paired with empathy helped me to successfully
resolve any disagreements I had with my peers quickly before it became
a problem. I was able to circumvent the issue and put myself in others’
shoes before getting upset. In addition, resilience and drive for excellence
played a big part in my motivation to study hard, giving me good exam results
and ensuring that I never fell behind in class. Lastly, knowing how beneficial
teamwork can be, I was always happy to help and be helped by my peers,
making school life much less stressful.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>What advice would you give to current and future students? How can they develop the same level of resilience and determination that you have demonstrated?&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Shantell: </strong>Learn how to time manage well and to seize
the opportunities you have. Find a system of planning and tracking tasks
that works well for you, so that you can stay organised and ahead of your
deadlines. Don’t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone when opportunities
arise as these experiences will contribute significantly to your growth.
However, it is equally as important not to overcommit, ensuring a healthy
balance to manage challenges effectively. As for developing resilience,
have a clear goal and find the reason for chasing that goal. Make sure
that you also have a good support system that can be both a safety net
and driving force for you to achieve your goals.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Janessa: </strong>Trust the process. When the going gets tough,
the tough get going. I feel that as long as students believe in themselves,
they can develop the same level of resilience and determination.</p>
