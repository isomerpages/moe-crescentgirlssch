<h3>National Day Celebrations</h3>
<p>
<br>National Day Celebrations at Crescent Girls' School was vibrant and memorable,
brimming with activities that embodied the spirit of togetherness. The
event began with the National Day Parade at the parade square, where the
Uniformed Groups proudly marched in as the CGSSB played a stirring tune.
The entire school community then came together to sing the National Anthem
and recite the pledge with heartfelt enthusiasm, symbolizing the unity
of all Singaporeans. Following this, students engaged in a lively dance
session and explored various booths organized by the supportive Parent
Support Group, adding to the day's excitement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The highlight of the day was the auditorium celebration, organized
by the CrezCommunity Leaders, featuring captivating performances by the
Performing Arts CCAs, leaving the audience in awe. The festivities concluded
with the Crescent tradition of singing "Home" and forming the iconic Crescent
train. It was a truly joyous and unforgettable experience for all Crescentians,
leaving everyone with a deep sense of pride and unity.</p>
