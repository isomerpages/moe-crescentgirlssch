<h4><strong>A Whimsical World of Chocolate: Champion Seminar 2024</strong></h4>
<p>The colorful and imaginative world of <em>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</em> was
brought to life at Champion Seminar 2024. This inspired adaptation of Roald
Dahl's beloved classic was a tribute to all CCAs, echoing the sentiment
of Arthur O'Shaughnessy's poem "Ode": "We are the music makers, and we
are the dreamers of dreams."</p>
<p>The talented cast captured the essence of each character, from the eccentric
Wooly Wonka to the innocent Charlie. The stage transformed into a magical
wonderland, filled with rivers of fudge, hanging treats and lollipops as
large as one's face. The audience was captivated by the vibrant costumes,
catchy songs, and stunning choreography. CCA leaders even joined in the
fun, adding their own unique flair to the performance.</p>
<p>At the event's conclusion, members of the CCAs presented tokens of appreciation
to their teachers and instructors for their guidance and dedication. The
teachers and instructors were visibly moved as their students expressed
gratitude with heartfelt notes and gifts.</p>
<p>To close the seminar, the two CCAs of the year—NCC and Track and Field—were
announced. Giselle Tay, Unit Sergeant Major of NCC, and Goh Rae Ann, Captain
of Track and Field, delivered inspiring speeches about their journeys and
challenges, receiving thunderous applause from the audience.</p>
<p>Champion Seminar 2024 was a fitting tribute to the efforts and achievements
of all CCAs, inspiring everyone to reach even greater heights in the coming
year.</p>
