<p><strong>Teacher’s Day Celebrations</strong>
</p>
<p>
<br>On Teachers' Day, we pay tribute to the lighthouses that lead us over
the wide oceans of our rocky journeys. This year’s celebration, themed
"Lighthouse: Our Beacon of Light”, highlights the important role that teachers
and staff play in guiding us Crescentians. Certainly, our teachers have
been constantly helping us through difficult times and acknowledging our
many accomplishments throughout our journey in Crescent, much like how
a lighthouse stands tall in the middle of a rocky sea.
<br>
<br>Celebrating Teachers’ Day was our way of showing our appreciation to our
guiding lights, featuring heartfelt speeches and creative performances
by Crescentians that captured the spirit of mentorship and dedication.
The atmosphere during the event was both reflective and celebratory, as
students came together to express their unwavering gratitude. This event
also included many special heartfelt sharing where Crescentians shared
personal experiences of how their teachers had been their lighthouses,
illuminating and guiding them on their journey.
<br>
<br>Filled with the lively Crescent spirit, Crescentians cheered excitedly
and eagerly handed out gifts to their teachers for their countless hours
of dedication, care and encouragement. Yet others were capturing the moments
of joy, appreciation, and gratitude on film.
<br>
<br>From touching videos to the heartfelt performances, this special event
encapsulated our appreciation for our teachers. Thank you for being our
constant lighthouses, patiently guiding us towards success and growth.
Happy Teachers' Day!&nbsp;</p>
