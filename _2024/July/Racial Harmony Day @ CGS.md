<p>Racial Harmony Day@CGS</p>
<p>This year, Crescent Girlsâ€™ commemorated Racial Harmony Day with a multicultural
performance featuring various cultural instruments. Each instrument showcased
its unique history and meaning; yet together, they harmonised beautifully.
This illustrates the idea that despite our individual differences, we can
create a unified and harmonious 'melody' of our own. To embrace this diversity,
I took it upon myself to wear a half-sari instead of my usual cheongsam,
immersing myself in a different culture and learning from my Indian friends
who taught me how to fold it. This enriching experience was a wonderful
opportunity for both my friends and I to foster a deeper appreciation for
each other's traditions.</p>
<p>During our CCE session in class, we further explored inter-racial relationships
in Singapore, emphasising our society's multicultural values. Our teacher's
personal stories highlighted the progress of our society from one which
had a less diverse past, culturally, to our more inclusive community today.
One good example is reflected in the variety of cultural foods sold in
school to accommodate diverse dietary needs, as well as offering us opportunities
to explore different cuisines.&nbsp;</p>
