<p><strong>Student Leaders’ Investiture</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CGS held its annual Student Leaders’ Investiture on 2 July 2024. The one-hour
event acknowledged the contributions of Crescent’s various student leaders,
including CCA Executive Committee (EXCO) members, Class Committee members,
as well as the EXCO members of HOUSE, the CrezCommunity Leaders and Student
Council. The Investiture also saw the beginning of a new chapter in leadership
for a new generation of student leaders, as they stepped up to bring pride
to the Crescentian Family in their various avenues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The theme of this year’s Investiture was “ The Butterfly Effect: Small
Actions, Driving Change”. Coupled with the logo depicting butterflies circling
a rippling puddle of water, the theme was inspired by the idea of the chaos
theory. The idea of this theory is that small things can have an indirect
impact on a complex system. Mirroring the theory, the theme served as a
reminder for Crescent’s student leaders that their actions can cause ripple
effects within the Crescentian Community. It highlighted the importance
of their decisions, behaviour and initiatives in contributing to a larger
picture of change.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In every leader is a spark that can ignite the flames in those who follow
them. As they continue flying the school flag high, may Crescent’s student
leaders remember their role and significance in inspiring innovation and
transformation in the Crescent Community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
