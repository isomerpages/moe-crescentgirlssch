<h4><strong>Minecraft Edventure Quest (MEQ) 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Four students from Crescent Girls' School were chosen to participate in
the inaugural Minecraft Edventure Quest (MEQ) 2024, a collaborative event
with Microsoft Singapore. The participants were Isabel Kang Ting Xuan (3S6),
Kimberly Sierra (3S7), Tiara Kasih (3G4), and Elisha Lam Ruey Han (3G4).
The MEQ program aimed to introduce AI and programming through Python or
Java within the game Minecraft, focusing on creating innovative and inclusive
community designs. This year's theme, “Inclusive Community Grid” or “Inclusive
Recreation Spaces,” inspired students to think creatively about public
spaces, leading our team to redesign Clementi MRT Station Exit A for better
inclusivity.</p>
<p>This experience was more than a coding challenge; it was a comprehensive
lesson in teamwork and community planning. Engaging in numerous team discussions,
I gained insights into the importance of collaboration and the impact of
diverse perspectives on our project. The programming aspect of MEQ was
especially transformative, enhancing my problem-solving skills and independent
coding abilities. This hands-on, unguided approach made the learning process
both exciting and impactful. Participating in MEQ also involved forming
teams with students from other schools, which added a valuable dimension
of social mixing to the experience. Eventually, my team emerged one of
the winners, attaining <strong>Master of the Block – Digital Architect</strong> award.</p>
<p>Overall, MEQ significantly enriched my skills and appreciation for collaborative,
community-focused efforts, making it a highly recommendable experience.</p>
