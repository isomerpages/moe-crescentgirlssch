<p>CGS held its first ever Art exhibition from 17-23 May 2024, featuring&nbsp;150
pieces of artworks&nbsp;selected from the&nbsp;entire 2023 cohort of Secondary
1 and 2 classes. This exhibition not only celebrated the artistic talent
and dedication of our students, but also provided them with a platform
to showcase their visual arts skills and express their creativity to a
broader audience. By featuring four different art forms — painting, sculpture,
digital art, and linocut prints—the exhibition aims to promote the value
of artistic diversity and encourage students to explore various media to
express their ideas. The exhibition also serves as an engaging and enriching
event for our school community, fostering a sense of pride in the artistic
achievements of our students.</p>

<p>The Art exhibition was a great way for students to express their creativity
and gain inspiration by viewing all the unique pieces displayed. For many
Art students, this enjoyable experience opened a whole new world for them
as they got to learn many different artistic styles that have inspired
them to try and experiment with during their Art lessons.</p>
<p>Students who contributed to the planning of this exhibition by pasting
the artworks onto the whiteboards and arranging the sculptures gained new
perspectives and greater appreciation for the subject and felt it was truly
a great way to expose them to the world of Art.</p>
