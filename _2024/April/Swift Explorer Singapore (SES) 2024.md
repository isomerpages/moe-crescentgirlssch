<h4><strong>Swift Explorers Singapore (SES) 2024</strong></h4>
<p>Participating in Swift Explorers Singapore's App Design challenge, we
learned to design a user-focused application called BULB Math, aimed at
helping teenagers improve their math skills. This project involved basic
coding with Swift Playgrounds on the iPad and utilized design thinking
principles taught through the Lower Secondary Computer Education Programme
(LSCEP). Our training was supported by Tinkercademy, an Apple Professional
Learning Provider, and we incorporated resources from Apple to develop
our computational thinking and creative problem-solving skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The creation of BULB Math was guided by feedback from our target audience,
leading to features like a feedback function that is activated after correcting
answers. We faced technical challenges, such as having to design app icons
in Keynote by merging different shapes. Despite these hurdles, we successfully
developed an innovative and aesthetically pleasing application.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our efforts were recognised and we were selected to represent our school
at the SES Celebration Event on August 14, where we presented BULB Math
to judges and peers. This experience not only enhanced our public speaking
skills and boosted our confidence but also provided a profound sense of
achievement and a memorable learning journey.</p>
