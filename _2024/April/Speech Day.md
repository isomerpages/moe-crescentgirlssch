<h4>Speech Day 2024: Breaking Barries, Pursuing Dreams</h4>
<p>Speech Day is an annual event celebrated by Crescent to commemorate and
showcase the achievements of our students. It is an occasion where students,
teachers, alumni, and guests come together to honour these Crescentians.
<br>
<br>Themed Breaking Barries, Pursuing Dreams, the event began with a performance
by Crescentâ€™s Symphonic Band, followed by speeches delivered by our Principal,
Mrs Helen Chong, as well as from our Guest-Of-Honour, Ms Sally Seow, multi-trade
entrepreneur and President of the CGS Alumnae Association. It was then
followed by various prize presentations, including academic and Co-Curricular
Activity (CCA) awards, highlighting the diverse talents and accomplishments
of the student body.
<br>
<br>Speech Day is not only a time for celebration but also a moment for reflection,
as it allows everyone involved to appreciate the legacy of Crescentians
in the past year. It fosters a sense of community and pride, inspiring
students to continue striving for excellence and upholding the values of
Crescent.
