<p>Cross Country 2024 was a fulfilling experience for all Crescentians as
it was the first physical cross country since Covid times. Held at the
Bedok Reservoir, Crescentians took part in the inter-house ‘minute-to-win-it’
games, the cheer competition as well as witnessed the mascot parade. The
mascots, made out of recycled cardboard and painted in the respective House
colours, were donned by Sec 2 House Leaders who paraded around for photo
opportunities with the spectators as they cheered loudly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were 2 categories, the competitive run and the fun run. Students
who participated in the competitive race were all awarded House points
and rewarded with thunderous applause as they finished their impressive
feat of running 3.2km in record timings. In the fun run, Crescentians enjoyed
a leisurely 3.6km scenic route with their friends.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Champion House for Cross Country went to Bronte House, and you could
feel and hear the intense elation of the Bronte Crocs in the crowd when
the results were announced. All in all, it was an enjoyable and exhilarating
experience for everyone, and a great way to end off the first term in 2024.</p>
