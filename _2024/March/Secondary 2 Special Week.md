<p>Term 1 Week 10 was indeed aptly termed ‘Special Week’. It was a week filled
with a series of engaging activities which focused on the holistic development
of the students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>My favourite activity was ‘Roots for Change!’, a fun and meaningful activity
where my class and I had to lift up saplings, cut open the bag they were
in, put the sapling into an available pre-dug hole in the soil, and put
sufficient soil into it.</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Public Speaking Skills and The Creation of a Poetic Script” was yet another
awesome activity we engaged in where we mastered many useful skills, from
the right way to pronounce words to tips on how to deliver a good presentation,
skills that we Crescentians will take along with us even after we graduate.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout the special week, Crescentians engaged in enriching activities
organized by the Mother Tongue Language department for the MTL Fortnight.
These included performances by special traditional Chinese drummers and
guest appearances by two DJs from YES933 and Media Corp actors, who spoke
about their work experience. We also enjoyed traditional cultural games
of the various local races, from puppet making to calligraphy and face
mask painting!</p>
<p></p>
<p>Special Week ended on a high note with the Cross-Country Run at Bedok
Reservoir on a fine Friday morning. Competitive Runners ran 3.2km, while
Recreational Runners had the choice to either run or walk 3.6km. Recreational
Runners also had a fun time participating in various HOUSE activities led
by the HOUSE Leaders to strengthen and cultivate HOUSE Spirit before running.
Although the run was tiring, I felt really accomplished and touched to
see how Crescentians encouraged and motivated each other throughout the
race as they walked and ran together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Overall, Crescentians had an enriching and fruitful week. Although Special
Week is over, the memories and lessons I have learnt will always stay Special
in my heart.</p>
