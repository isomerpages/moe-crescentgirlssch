### **Student Leaders’ Investiture**
Held on the 30th of June 2020, the 7th Student Leaders' Investiture took on a different approach in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead of the usual gathering in the auditorium, this year's event took place in our classrooms. While still keeping the essence of an investiture, probation leaders were formally welcomed into their respective leadership groups and our dedicated Sec 4 leaders stepped down after serving the school with their contributions.

The theme of the investiture was "Crescita: Many Leaves, One Tree" and it was a reminder for all student leaders to stay grounded while seeing every opportunity as a platform to grow as servant leaders.

The investiture was kick-started with a speech by our principal, Mrs Chong. With great passion and conviction, she showed us how true leadership is not about being on the pedestal all the time, but it is instead, grounded in the principle of servanthood. 

The new student leaders beamed with pride as their form teachers presented them with respective badges, ties or whistles, while the outgoing Secondary Fours nostalgically recalled their days in leadership, knowing that the fruits of their labour had ripened. Despite this year’s investiture being a little different, it did not stop the Crescentians from showing their continual support and admiration through resounding claps and cheers, which reverberated through the classrooms.

Indeed, this investiture is merely a small snippet of how much our leadership journey is changing amidst this unprecedented situation. However, just as how our seniors have embodied adaptability, we look forward to grow through what we go through!
