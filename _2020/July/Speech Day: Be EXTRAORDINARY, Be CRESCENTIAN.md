### **Speech Day: Be EXTRAORDINARY, Be CRESCENTIAN**
Although this year’s Speech Day was held in our respective classrooms, it was still as meaningful and memorable. The cheers that echoed through the corridors as our fellow classmates received their awards were very heart-warming. It was wonderful to know that even though we may have been physically separated, we were still united in wholly supporting our friends.
