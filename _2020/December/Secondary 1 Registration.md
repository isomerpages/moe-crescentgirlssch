### **Secondary 1 Registration**
Dear Parents/Guardians,  

Crescent Girls’ School would like to warmly welcome you to our Crescentian family. The Secondary One Registration Exercise marks the start of your daughter’s/ward’s journey at Crescent. We look forward to building a strong partnership with you to support your daughter/ward as she develops into a lady and leader. 

Please access your Parents Gateway account for links to the registration form, online briefings and Sec 1 Registration package. Parents without Parents Gateway are to fill in the form below. The registration materials will then be forwarded to you via email. 

Thank you.
