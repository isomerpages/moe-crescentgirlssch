On 25th&nbsp;February 2020, the Crescent Academy for Digital Age Learning (CrADLe) organised the Digital Age Learning Conference (DALC). The conference, attended by more than 300 educators around Singapore, offered participants an opportunity to attend various sharings by members of the fraternity, to discover how educators leverage ICT affordances in designing learning experiences around the AfL framework in order to cultivate the joy of learning, and to develop 21st&nbsp;Century Competencies in the students.
