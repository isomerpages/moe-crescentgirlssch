<h4><strong>Sec 1 Orientation Campfire</strong></h4>
<p>The Sec 1 Orientation Campfire, organised by the Crescent Girl Guides,
was a fun, vibrant and meaningful event that warmly welcomed the new students
into the Crescent family. Held at the start of the academic year, the campfire
provided an excellent platform for the Secondary 1 students to interact
beyond their classrooms, make new friends and develop a sense of belonging
in their new school environment. Throughout the evening, students participated
in lively Girl Guides’ campfire songs, energetic cheers and interactive
group games designed to break the ice and encourage teamwork. This created
a supportive atmosphere where the students could bond not only with one
another but also with their seniors, who played an active role in guiding,
encouraging and cheering them on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the evening was an entertaining skit presented
by the Crescent Girl Guides, which drew laughter from the audience and
showcased the Guiders’ creativity. The mass-dance segment that followed
brought everyone onto their feet, contributing to the upbeat mood and unity
among participants. In addition to the Girl Guides, other CCAs showcased
their talents through performances ranging from rhythmic displays to music
and dance, demonstrating the rich diversity of interests and strengths
within the school community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the campfire was a memorable and enriching experience that built
confidence, strengthened friendships and fostered a strong sense of school
spirit among the Secondary 1 students. Many left the event feeling excited
about the year ahead and grateful for the warm welcome they received as
new members of Crescent.&nbsp;</p>
