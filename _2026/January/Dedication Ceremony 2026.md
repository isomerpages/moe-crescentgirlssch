<h4>Dedication Ceremony 2026</h4>
<p>The Dedication Ceremony is an annual Crescent tradition where we officially
welcome our younger sisters into the Crescentian family. It is a deeply
meaningful and memorable occasion, bringing staff and students together
as we pledge our dedication and love for the school.</p>
<p>To mark the special initiation of the Secondary One Crescentians, the
eldest sisters of the family — our Secondary Four seniors — are given the
honour of pinning the school badge on our little sisters. This symbolic
gesture marks the very first time they wear the badge with pride. Along
with the badge, we also presented them with handwritten notes filled with
advice, encouragement, and reassurance, reminding them that they will always
have the support of the Crescentian family.</p>
<p>We were privileged to have three distinguished guests join us for the
ceremony: Mr S Sivaram, Chairman of the School Advisory Committee; Ms Sally
Seow, President of the Crescent Girls’ School Alumnae Association; and
Mdm Cynthia Tay, Chairperson of the Parent Support Group.</p>
<p>A special moment followed as all Crescentians took our pledge of commitment
to the school. For the Secondary Ones, it was their first; for us Secondary
Fours, our last. This made the ceremony especially meaningful and a little
emotional — a moment that will remain etched in my memory.</p>
<p>We ended with our Crescent cheer, shouting our school’s name with pride
in both our voices and our hearts. I was reminded of the day my own badge
was pinned by an elder sister, and standing in her place now, I realised
how the Crescentian spirit continues to be passed down from one generation
to the next.</p>
