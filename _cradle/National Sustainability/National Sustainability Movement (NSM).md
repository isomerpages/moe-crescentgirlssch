<p>The objectives of NSM are as follows:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To support schools in the design, implementation and review of sustainability
initiatives that are in alignment with the Ministry of Education’s (MOE)
Eco-Stewardship Programme (ESP) and the SG Green Plan 2030 (SGP 2030).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide learning opportunities for schools’ green champions, educators,
and management team with a view to enable them to strengthen sustainability
efforts through professional development and relevant programmes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To educate and inspire students to be eco-stewards and take action in
promoting a culture of sustainability in the school and community.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The enduring theme for the National Sustainability Movement (NSM) is <strong>‘Building a Generation of Eco Stewards’</strong>.
With SGP 2030 being a whole-of-nation movement, NSM also seeks to galvanise
a whole-of-school movement on sustainable living across schools in Singapore
such that there is a broader mindset change and environmentally conscious
habits holistically integrated within the school context and sustained
for wider impact in the long run.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>NSM consists of 3 segments, with each segment pitched at different school
stakeholders:</p>
