It is a perfect opportunity for the students to learn design-thinking principles and other skills high sought for in the digital marketplace.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Participants can also gain e-certificates and CCA points if they have performed well in the SES 2023. Accompanying teachers, Teacher Coding Champions (TCC), can also attain Professional Learning certificates upon completion of SES coding workshops.</p>
