<p>Crescent Girls’ School (CGS) and School of Science and Technology (SST)
are proud to organise Swift Explorers Singapore (SES) 2024!</p>
<p><em>Join us to discover the wonders of coding!</em>
</p>
<p>SES 2024 is a programme designed to empower students and teachers in the
field of app development. SES 2024 is organised using resources from Apple,
with training supported by Tinkercademy, an Apply Professional Learning
Provider.</p>
<p>Through this programme, students will learn how to design an app connected
to a topic they care about. Students will hone computational thinking and
creative problem-solving skills through basic coding on the iPad. Coding
with Swift is a powerful, intuitive, and easy-to-learn programming language
which provides students with fun and engaging ways to prepare for the future.</p>
<p>SES 2024 is designed to support Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) for Primary,
Secondary, Junior College and Millenia Institute students. Accompanying
teachers may also attend similar coding and app development workshops.</p>
<p>In addition, selected participants will have an opportunity to engage
with real-world developers, build their app, and showcase their work to
industry leaders.</p>
<p>The programme is free for all public education institutions to participate.</p>

<h4><strong>What’s New?</strong></h4>
<p>This year we are excited to launch the programme with a brand-new curriculum
and two exciting challenges:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>App Design Challenge</strong>: Led by Crescent Girls' School (CGS),
this challenge focuses on design thinking and basic coding with Swift Playgrounds
on the iPad. Participants will create innovative and user-friendly apps
that solve real-world problems.</p>
<p><strong>App Development Challenge</strong>: Headed by School of Science
and Technology (SST), Singapore, this challenge dives deeper into the technical
aspects of app development. Participants will build utility apps with cutting-edge
technologies like Augmented Reality (AR) and Machine Learning (Core ML),
all with Swift Playgrounds on the iPad.</p>
<p><strong>Celebrate Your Students’ Achievements:</strong>The experience
culminates in a Celebration event on August 14, 2024 (tentative) at Crescent
Girls' School. At this event, you will:</p>
