<p style="text-align:justify;">Crescent Girlsâ€™ School (CGS) is proud to organise Swift Explorers Singapore (SES) 2023!</p>

Join us to discover the wonders of coding!  

<p style="text-align:justify;">SES 2023 is a series of free online coding related activities using resources from Apple, hosted by CGS with training provided by Tinkercademy, an Apple Professional Learning Provider.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Through this programme, students will learn how to design an app connected to a topic they care about. Students will hone computational thinking and creative problem-solving skills through basic coding on the iPad. Coding with Swift is a powerful, intuitive and easy-to-learn programming language which provides students with fun and engaging ways to prepare for the future.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">SES 2023 is designed to support Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) for Primary, Secondary, Junior College and Millenia Institute students. Accompanying teachers may also attend similar coding and app development workshops.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"> In addition, selected participants will have an opportunity to engage with real-world developers, build their app, and showcase their work to industry leaders.</p>

  
  

The programme is free for all public education institutions to participate.
