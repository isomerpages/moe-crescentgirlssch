### **Professional Learning (NEW)**
**Professional Learning (NEW)<br>
2020**

COVID-19 saw the need for us to accelerate the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) and all secondary schools will embark on the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) from 2021. Equipping each secondary school student with a personal learning device (PLD) necessitates a whole-school approach to re-inventing teaching and learning. No less important a decision to make is the choice of the e-learning platform for shaping our students’ PDLP experience.

CrADLe would like to invite school key personnel to join Crescent Girls’ School (CGS) in the first of a series of professional learning webinars. The key personnel from CGS will share how they have transformed their curricula, pedagogies, assessment practices, administration and collaboration through the use of our learning platform, Microsoft TEAMS. TEAMS, when used together with OneNote Class Notebook, has huge potential to transform teaching and learning in schools. CGS has received several requests from schools to share on our experience with 1-to-1 computing and we understand the urgency for schools which are embarking on their own PDLP journey to have access to information they need in order to make informed decisions. CrADLe is organising this webinar specially for schools keen to learn more about how Microsoft TEAMS can serve their needs.
