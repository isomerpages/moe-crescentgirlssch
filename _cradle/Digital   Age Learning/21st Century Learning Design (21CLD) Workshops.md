### **21st Century Learning Design (21CLD) Workshops**
The development of 21st century skills must be intentionally designed so that students can develop those skills. Crescent collaborated with Stanford Research Institute, International (SRI) to develop a set of rubrics for teachers to use in lesson design and co-designed a set of rubrics to assess students’ competencies.  

We have conducted workshops for a few secondary schools who wished to adopt the framework at the school level. Contact us at [cradle@crescent.edu.sg](mailto:cradle@crescent.edu.sg) if you wish to find out more about 21CLD.
