<p>In support of MOE’s continued efforts to promote Sustainable Living under
SGP 2030, SAC serves as a refreshed outreach programme that replaces the
National Youth Upcycling Movement (NYUM) previously jointly organized by
Crescent Girls’ School and Terra SG.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through its ‘<strong>By Youths, For All</strong>’ student-centric approach,
SAC empowers each student team to achieve the following objectives:&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) <strong>[Environmental Education] </strong>To educate youth regarding
environmental sustainability and conservation issues.</p>
<p>b)<strong>[Environmental Stewardship]</strong> To nurture youths to be
eco-stewards who are inspired to take action in promoting a culture of
sustainable living and actively practise green citizenry that contributes
to a sustainable Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For SAC 2024, there will be two available tracks for which schools can
sign up:</p>
