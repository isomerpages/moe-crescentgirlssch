<p>In support of MOE’s continued efforts to promote Sustainable Living under
SGP 2030, SAC serves as a refreshed outreach programme that replaces the
National Youth Upcycling Movement (NYUM) previously jointly organized by
Crescent Girls’ School and Terra SG.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through its ‘<strong>By Youths, For All</strong>’ student-centric approach,
SAC empowers each student team to achieve the following objectives:&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) <strong>[Environmental Education] </strong>To educate youth regarding
environmental sustainability and conservation issues.</p>
<p>b)<strong>[Environmental Stewardship]</strong> To nurture youths to be
eco-stewards who are inspired to take action in promoting a culture of
sustainable living and actively practise green citizenry that contributes
to a sustainable Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For SAC 2024, there will be two available tracks for which schools can
sign up:</p>

<h3><strong>Advocacy Module</strong></h3>
<p>Participating schools can nominate a team of 3 to 5 students from Primary
4 upwards to collaborate and act as Green Champions to pilot sustainability
efforts in schools and execute their planned outreach activities. Students
in participating teams are strongly encouraged to be <strong>creators</strong>, <strong>connectors</strong> and <strong>contributors</strong> and
spearhead their own sustainability initiative(s). The Green Champions can
come up with their own authentic, interesting and engaging activities to
reach out to as many members of the community as possible.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are 3 phases of movement in the SAC Advocacy Module.</p>

<p><strong><u>Phase 1: Learn</u></strong>
</p>
<p>All members of participating teams are strongly encouraged to sign up
for and to attend the <strong>SAC Symposium</strong> that will take place
from <strong>1.30pm to 4.30pm</strong> on <strong>11 March 2024</strong> in
Crescent Girls’ School. The Symposium comprises a keynote address and a
training bootcamp, allowing participants to be equipped with the necessary
knowledge and skills to design their community outreach project.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Phase 2: Create</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Teams will then collaborate to design their own authentic, interesting
and engaging activities/initiatives to promote sustainable living and in
doing so, they are able to reach out to as many members of the community
(school / neighbourhood etc.) Teams are strongly encouraged to attend an <strong>online Presentation-cum-Consultation session </strong>at
a later date in late Term 2 to showcase their advocacy plans to an expert
panel for feedback. Participation in this consultation session is option.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong><u>Phase 3: Advocate</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Teams will then execute their advocacy plans/sustainability initiatives
anytime from 12 March to 8 September 2024. Teams will need to submit a <strong>Final Report </strong>that
documents their advocacy plans /sustainability initiatives (planning stage
to implementation stage, reflections etc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Three categories of awards (Gold, Silver and Bronze) will be presented
at the end of SAC to recognise the achievements of every team. Participation
in the SAC may also be considered as part of the school’s contribution
to efforts in environmental conservation when applying for the School Green
Awards.</p>
