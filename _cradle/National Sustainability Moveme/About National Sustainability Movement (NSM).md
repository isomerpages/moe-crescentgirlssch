<h4><strong>Building a Generation of Eco Stewards</strong></h4>
<p>Launched in 2024, the inaugural <strong>National Sustainability Movement (NSM)</strong> is
jointly<strong> </strong>organised by Crescent Girls’ School and Terra
SG.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h4><strong>2. Theme for the 2023 Challenge</strong></h4>
<p>The theme for NYUM 2023 is <strong>‘Trash To Treasure’</strong>.</p>
<p>In a ‘<strong>By Youths, For All</strong>’ student-centric approach, the
NYUM provides an opportunity for students to design and create upcycled
household items using waste materials, with guidance from experts and consultants
in the industry.</p>
<p>NYUM also seeks to develop student voice and agency. Teams are tasked
to plan and execute their advocacy plans, not only to reach out to, but
also to engage as many members of the public as possible, through various
team-proposed outreach events and activities, to promote the culture of
environmental sustainability through upcycling of waste materials.</p>
