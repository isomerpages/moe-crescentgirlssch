**Preparation Stage**

*   Schools are to plan for a one-hour time slot to go through the package in their own school (e.g. the lesson package may be carried out as a Post-Midyear/Year-End Exam Activity).

*   Schools will access the lesson package on a webpage and go through the lesson package beforehand. Schools will conduct the one-hour lesson package on their own. There will be materials for dissemination which schools may choose to print or distribute digitally.
