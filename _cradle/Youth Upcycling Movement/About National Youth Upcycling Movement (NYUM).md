### **About NYUM**

<img src="/images/nyum1.png" style="width:45%">

#### **1. Categories for the Challenge**
There are 2 categories for participation for Primary Schools / Secondary / Post-Secondary Institutions:
*   Enrichment Module
*   Advocacy Module

#### **2. Theme for the 2023 Challenge**

The theme for NYUM 2023 is **‘Trash To Treasure’**.

In a ‘**By Youths, For All**’ student-centric approach, the NYUM provides an opportunity for students to design and create upcycled household items using waste materials, with guidance from experts and consultants in the industry.

NYUM also seeks to develop student voice and agency. Teams are tasked to plan and execute their advocacy plans, not only to reach out to, but also to engage as many members of the public as possible, through various team-proposed outreach events and activities, to promote the culture of environmental sustainability through upcycling of waste materials.

#### **3. Phases in the Enrichment Module**
