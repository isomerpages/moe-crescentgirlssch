<p>On 4 September 2025, Crescentians gathered once again to celebrate our
teachers with a series of vibrant performances for Teachers’ Day. The audience
was treated to a dazzling showcase of talent — from the melodious harmonies
of the Choir and the rhythmic beats of the Angklung Ensemble, to the dynamic
moves of the Dance Club and the spirited performance by the Student Leadership
Executive Committee (EXCO) of 2024–2025. Whether part of a CCA item or
a self-initiated act, each performance shared one heartfelt purpose: to
express gratitude to our teachers and the school’s non-teaching staff.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps, this time, our resounding “G-O-O-D J-O-B!” was not only a cheer
for the performers but also a meaningful tribute from all Crescentians
to our educators and staff — a collective way of saying, <em>“Thank you for your dedication. You’ve done a good job!”</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Crescent, both teachers and students play integral roles in shaping
our school journey. The annual Teachers’ Day celebration reminds us to
pause and appreciate the individuals who inspire, guide, and support us
every day. That is the true essence of Teachers’ Day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we continue to innovate through fresh performances and creative
planning, may we also carry this spirit of gratitude beyond the occasion
itself. Whether it’s a warm smile, a simple thank-you note, or a cheerful
“Good job!”, let us keep the Crescentian spirit alive — one affirmation
at a time.&nbsp;</p>
