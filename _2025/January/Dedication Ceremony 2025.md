<p>14 February 2025 marked a special occasion for Crescent Girls’ School
as we celebrated our annual Dedication Ceremony. This event served as a
heartfelt opportunity for both staff and students to pledge their dedication
and love to the Crescentian family.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, all teaching and non-teaching staff were introduced
to the students by our Principal Ms Cindy Low, while the Secondary One
cohort and new students from other levels were warmly welcomed into the
Crescentian community by their Crescentian seniors. The Dedication Ceremony
was indeed meaningful as we ecstatically cheered for the staff and new
students as they officially became part of the family.</p>
<p>One of the most poignant moments came during the badge-pinning segment,
when the Secondary Four Crescentians initiated their Secondary One juniors
by pinning the school badge onto their blouses and handing each a special
note of encouragement. This act was both nostalgic and emotional for the
Secondary Four students, as they recalled the moment four years ago when
their own seniors had pinned their badges, symbolizing the passing of the
Crescentian baton from one cohort to the next, and ensuring the flame of
Crescent’s spirit continues to burn brightly.</p>
<p>The true essence of the Crescent spirit shone through as we united in
a single voice, reciting the Pupil’s Creed and renewing our vows to uphold
Crescent’s motto and values, no matter where life may take us. Our passion
and enthusiasm were evident as we concluded the ceremony, cheering together
as one large “CRESCENT!”-tian family.</p>
