<p>The Orientation Campfire is an annual event organized by the Girl Guides
to provide the Secondary One students with a memorable conclusion to their
Orientation Programme.</p>
<p>This year, the theme of the Orientation Campfire was <em>Ascendere</em>,
which means “to climb” in Latin. Although the wet weather required us to
activate our contingency plan and move the event to the Indoor Sports Hall,
the excitement and energy remained just as electrifying. The various CCAs
put on captivating performances that left the audience in awe, while the
Secondary Ones were fully engaged, appreciating the dedication and effort
behind each act. In turn the rest of the school showed their unwavering
support, cheering on the Secondary Ones as they performed their campfire
songs, skits, and other acts with enthusiasm.</p>
<p>As organizers of this event, we gained valuable insights throughout the
experience. Most importantly, we learned the significance of teamwork and
coordination within our CCA, as bringing the campfire to life required
collective effort. Additionally, working alongside other CCAs allowed us
to strengthen our connections within the school community. This journey
also helped us identify our strengths and areas for improvement, ensuring
that we continue to grow and enhance future campfires.</p>
<p>The Orientation Campfire was an enriching and unforgettable experience
for all the Guides, making it a defining highlight of our CCA. <em>We build, we strike, we ignite</em>—true
to our motto, we are confident that we ignited the Secondary Ones' journey
like a fireball! More than just an event, this campfire made our new Secondary
Ones feel welcomed and encouraged them to step out of their comfort zones.</p>
<p>Overall, the campfire was a wonderful opportunity to showcase the spirit
of the Girl Guides, and we are incredibly proud and grateful to host this
key event for Crescent each year.</p>
