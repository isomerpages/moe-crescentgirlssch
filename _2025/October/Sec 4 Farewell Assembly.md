<p>The Farewell Assembly stands as one of the defining highlights of the
Secondary 4 experience — a heartfelt send-off marking the close of our
shared journey at Crescent. The event was truly memorable, beginning with
a touching showcase of class videos that captured the laughter, challenges,
and milestones that shaped our years together.</p>
<p>As we reminisced about these moments, we were inspired by the thoughtful
words of our Valedictorian, Clara Poon, who reminded us of our responsibility
to be compassionate ladies and leaders of tomorrow — individuals attuned
to the world around us. Our Principal, Ms. Cindy Low, also shared a poignant
message, likening us to pencils that are continually sharpened through
life’s experiences — each challenge refining and strengthening us.</p>
<p>The mass ceremony in the hall concluded meaningfully with the pinning
of our badges, a symbolic gesture of our independence and readiness to
embrace the future with confidence.</p>
<p>Back in our classrooms, the celebration continued with the presentation
of Academic Awards, ECHA, and Merit Awards. We also took time to express
our heartfelt appreciation to our classmates, Class Committees, Student
Peer Supporters, and teachers — the people who made our Crescent journey
so enriching and memorable.</p>
<p>In all, the Farewell Assembly was a beautiful and emotional culmination
of our secondary school years — a celebration of friendship, growth, and
resilience that we will carry close to our hearts, just like our Crescent
uniforms adorned with the signatures and messages of those who have been
part of our story.</p>
