<p>OBS was a daunting yet unforgettable experience for me. Months before
the camp, I was already anxious about living on my own for five days —
wondering what conditions I would be in, and what my watchmates would be
like. With my End-of-Year examinations just a week away, I had even considered
not going. Looking back, I’m so glad I did, because those five days became
some of the most memorable of my school life.
<br>
<br>When I first arrived at Camp 1 after the ferry ride, it felt like stepping
into my worst nightmare. But things changed quickly. Icebreakers helped
me bond with my watchmates, and soon we were laughing and setting up our
tents together. Sleeping outdoors for four nights — something I’d never
have done by choice — turned out to be surprisingly enjoyable. Talking
late into the night and sharing stories made me realise how special human
connections can be when you’re away from home and technology.
<br>
<br>The real adventure began on the second day, with high elements that tested
my courage and teamwork. Then came the 6-hour hike across uneven terrain
under the blazing sun, heavy camping packs weighing us down. The exhaustion
and humidity made everyone irritable, but after a short rest and a packet
of electrolytes each, our spirits lifted again. We motivated one another
to push forward, and the moment we reached our campsite was deeply rewarding.
<br>
<br>My favourite day was the sea expedition — kayaking for hours under the
open sky, feeling the rhythm of the waves. It was both calming and challenging,
but incredibly fulfilling. On the final day, we exchanged thank-you notes
and reflected on how much we had grown. I realised that even when my body
was ready to give up, my mind — and the encouragement of my watchmates
— kept me going.
<br>
<br>Those five days taught me resilience, teamwork, and leadership. More than
anything, they reminded me that the toughest challenges often bring out
the best in us. OBS was physically demanding but mentally enriching, and
I would have missed out on a golden opportunity had I not taken that leap
of faith.
