<p>Our overseas learning trip to Cambodia last May was a truly eye-opening
and enriching experience. We were immersed in the country’s vibrant culture
and history while also gaining the rare opportunity to connect with students
from The Angkor Intellectual Academy and Preahsisowath NGS. These exchanges
gave us insight into their school life and aspirations and reminded us
how much we can learn from one another.</p>
<p>Our visits to the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum and the Killing Fields were
deeply moving. Though emotionally taxing, they highlighted the importance
of remembering history to prevent such tragedies from happening again.
We were reminded of the need to uphold human dignity and respect for all,
regardless of our differences.</p>
<p>Another impactful stop was our visit to Impact Hub Phnom Penh, a space
that supports young Cambodian entrepreneurs driven by a passion for innovation
and social impact. We learned that successful entrepreneurship starts with
deeply understanding—and even “falling in love with—the problem,” not just
the solution. A meaningful business idea is rooted in empathy and the desire
to make a difference. We also visited the Singapore Embassy in Phnom Penh,
where we discovered how Singapore contributes to Cambodia through initiatives
like skills training and workforce development. This experience deepened
our appreciation for regional cooperation and how even small nations can
create lasting, positive change. Both visits reminded us that true innovation
and diplomacy are ultimately about improving lives.</p>
<p>One of the most memorable highlights was meeting the local students. Despite
differences in language and culture, we connected effortlessly through
shared interests and laughter. Crescentians had the chance to conduct STEM
activities, such as building catapults and ball catchers, which encouraged
teamwork, creativity, and confidence. The students were warm, confident,
and impressively multilingual—many could speak Khmer, English, and even
Chinese or French. Their schools also showcased a thoughtful blend of global
practices and local values, from Japan’s 5S Kaizen system to CCE lessons
adapted from Singapore. After-school clubs ranged from Science and Math
to baking, highlighting a hands-on approach to learning. One aspect that
stood out was their two-hour lunch break, which gave students time to rest
and revise before resuming lessons. It was a strong reminder that while
education systems may vary, each is uniquely designed to support the growth
and success of its learners.</p>
<p>This journey broadened our perspectives and reminded us of the importance
of learning from others with open hearts and minds. We gained a deeper
appreciation for Cambodia’s past, its resilience and people. We realise
we have so much more to learn and discover. We really appreciated being
given this chance to go with our schoolmates to Cambodia and it was a unique
experience for all of us.</p>
