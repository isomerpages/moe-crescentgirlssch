<p>In May 2025, 20 students and 5 teachers took part in a learning journey
to Hanoi, Vietnam. Designed to offer meaningful exposure beyond the classroom,
the trip focused on three key areas — education, culture, and innovation,
which encouraged students to step out of their comfort zones and broaden
their worldviews.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A major highlight of the trip was the school visits to Cau Giay
High School and Newton Grammar School. Students took part in classroom
activities and engaged in conversations with their Vietnamese peers. The
warm hospitality and open exchange created opportunities for connection
and mutual learning. Despite cultural and language differences, students
found common ground and gained insights into Vietnam’s education system
and youth culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Cultural experiences also played a significant role in the journey.
Through visits to important landmarks such as the Temple of Literature,
the Imperial Citadel of Thang Long, and the Ho Chi Minh Complex, students
were introduced to Vietnam’s rich history and national identity. These
visits offered space for reflection and helped students develop a deeper
appreciation for the stories and traditions that shape a country.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The group also explored Hanoi’s modern landscape through visits
to companies such as UPGen and FPT. These experiences provided a glimpse
into Vietnam’s growing innovation scene and the role young people play
in shaping the future. A dialogue with staff from the Singapore Embassy
further strengthened students’ understanding of regional ties and diplomacy
as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This journey was not only about discovering a new place, but also
about building confidence, cultural awareness, and lasting friendships.</p>
