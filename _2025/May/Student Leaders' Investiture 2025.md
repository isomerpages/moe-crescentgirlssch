<p>The annual Student Leaders’ Investiture (SLI), held on 20th May 2025 at
Crescent Girls’ School, marked a significant milestone for our newly appointed
Student Leaders. Centred on the theme <strong>“Polaris: A Beacon of Leadership,”</strong> the
event symbolised the unwavering commitment expected of our Student Leaders
as they embark on their journey of leadership and service, paving the way
with vision and conviction. As they take on their roles, these leaders
are reminded to remain steadfast even when their path ahead is unclear.&nbsp;</p>
<p> The ceremony aimed to formally invest Student Leaders with their roles,
instilling a sense of responsibility and inspiring them to lead with Courtesy,
Generosity and Sincerity. The atmosphere during the event was filled with
pride, as the school hall echoed with the thunderous applause from peers
and teachers. The sight of our Student Councillors, House Leaders, CrezCommunity
Leaders, CCA Executive Committee Leaders and Class Committee Members standing
confidently on stage, ready to uphold Crescent Girls Schools’ values, was
truly inspiring.&nbsp;</p>
<p> Throughout the ceremony, the Polaris theme resonated as a powerful reminder:
true leadership is not about status but about serving the school with resilience
and purpose. Like the North Star guiding others through darkness, our Student
Leaders are called to lead with strength and compassion.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p> This investiture was both a milestone and a call to action - urging our
Student Leaders to shine brightly, uplift others and inspire the next generation
to follow in their light.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
