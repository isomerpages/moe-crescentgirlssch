<p>What can a school trip teach you what textbooks can’t? My experience in
Sarawak showed me quite a lot.</p>
<p>Sarawak is home to 40 ethnic groups, such as the Iban, Orang Ulu, Melenau
and others. Visiting the Sarawak Cultural Village and seeing full scale
replicas of traditional longhouses made me understand the importance of
harmony in diversity. What stood out to me most was how these different
cultures respect each others’ traditions and live together peacefully while
still sharing a strong Sarawakian identity.</p>
<p>The highlight of the trip was visiting a local school in Kuching. The
students were just like us — curious and eager to learn. I even found students
with the same likes and interests as me! We joined them for a few lessons
and we even learnt how to play congkak. During the assembly programme,
my group had to present about Crescent’s CCAs to the entire secondary cohort.
Initially, we felt nervous, but the students’ enthusiasm gave us the encouragement
we needed to present confidently.</p>
<p>What made this trip so meaningful was not just what we saw, but what we
felt: Sarawakian hospitality, pride in tradition, and a sense of belonging.
I left Sarawak not just with pictures, but with a deeper appreciation for
cultural diversity.</p>
<p>This trip also taught me that culture is not history. Culture is something
to be preserved and celebrated. Coming back to Singapore, I had a deeper
sense of respect for other cultures and I made a promise to explore my
own as well.</p>
