<p>The day was Tuesday, 28 February 2025, and although it began with the
usual assembly in the parade square, there was an unmistakable buzz of
excitement in the air as various groups of people prepared to celebrate
the Chinese New Year.</p>
<p>In the canteen, the Parent Support Group delighted us with a variety of
delectable treats, ranging from cheesy nachos to spicy tteokbokki. Soon
after, the whole school eagerly gathered at the parade square for the day's
highlight—the lion dance. We cheered as the performers showcased their
energetic leaps, impressive feats, and rhythmic drumming. More surprises
awaited us in the auditorium, where we were treated to stunning performances
both by the students and teachers! The angklung ensemble kicked things
off with a lively rendition of <em>Gong Xi Fa Cai</em>, followed by our
talented Sec Fours, who wowed us with their guitar skills and vocal prowess.
The event also included traditional performances by our very own members
from the Modern and Chinese society, the Sun Wukong's martial arts demonstration
and the mesmerizing Bian Lian face-changing act by performers from the
Chuang Hui Learning Pte Ltd. However, the biggest surprise came when our
usually reserved teachers took to the stage, singing and dancing with infectious
enthusiasm!</p>
<p>The celebration soon drew to a close, ending with a bang—literally— as
balloons were popped to simulate firecrackers. This Chinese New Year was
truly one of the most memorable celebrations of our school year, one we
will cherish in our hearts forever.</p>
