<h4>BYD and CrezPicnic and CCA Day</h4>
<p>Crescentians kicked off Semester 2 with our annual Be Yourself Day, themed
‘Y2K TV Shows’! From Disney classics to musicals, cartoons, and live-action
series, each class embraced their chosen sub-theme and brought it to life
through creative and expressive outfits. The school was filled with colour,
excitement, and endless photo-worthy moments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the morning, all eyes were on the Fashion Parade, where classes competed
for the title of ‘Best Dressed’ at each level. With iconic theme songs
and images playing in the background, seven class representatives confidently
strutted down the runway to thunderous cheers from their schoolmates. The
creativity and class spirit on display left everyone in awe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later that day, CrezPicnic brought the school community together once
again. The auditorium buzzed with laughter and conversation as classes
gathered in circles, sharing a meal, snapping photos, and enjoying live
music. Pizzas and bubble tea were definite crowd-pleasers, but the real
highlight was the warm atmosphere of friendship and togetherness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following day, Crescentians proudly wore their CCA attire for CCA
Day, celebrating their co-curricular identities. From Inter-UG bonding
sessions to energetic water gun activities, the day was packed with fun
and camaraderie. As the events were planned by the CCA EXCOs themselves,
the experience felt especially personal and meaningful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, Be Yourself Day, CrezPicnic, and CCA Day offered Crescentians
a chance to express themselves and strengthen bonds—both within their classes
and across their CCAs—creating lasting memories to kickstart the new semester.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>CrezCarnival and CrezJam and CrezFair 2025</h4>
<p>On the third day of CrezUnité, Crescentians arrived at school proudly
donning their CrezUnité shirts, buzzing with excitement for the highly
anticipated CrezCarnival later that afternoon. The event featured a wide
array of activities that ignited their competitive spirit while ensuring
fun was at the heart of it all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Game booths like ‘Scoop-a-Ball’ and ‘Toss ‘n’ Topple’ drew large crowds,
giving Crescentians the chance to earn points and enter a Lucky Draw for
exciting class prizes. Meanwhile, creative craft stations such as ‘Balloon
Bazaar’ and ‘Band It!’ were equally popular, allowing students to make
fun balloon creations and matching accessories for themselves and their
friends. With film cameras, photo booths, snacks, drinks, and classic carnival
games, Crescentians were thrilled to experience a carnival designed just
for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The celebration continued into the evening with CrezJam. As the disco
ball shimmered and glow-sticks lit up the auditorium, it was the Crescentians
themselves who truly lit up the space—singing, dancing, and celebrating
together. Unexpected dance performances and a lively Crescent Train added
to the magic. As the night wore on, a slow song brought everyone to the
floor, offering a quiet moment of reflection on the memories made during
the week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day, CrezFair kept the momentum going. Teachers joined in the
fun, heightening the excitement. Booths like ‘Hungry Hippo’ and the ‘HydroHustle’
relay encouraged teamwork and friendly competition.</p>
<p>To cap off the incredible week, students received parting keychains—specially
designed by their peers—as a keepsake to remember the joy of CrezUnité
2025.&nbsp;</p>
