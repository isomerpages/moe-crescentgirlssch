<h4><strong>Racial Harmony Day</strong></h4>
<p>This year, Crescent Girls’ School was transformed into a beautiful mosaic
of colours during our Racial Harmony Day celebrations as students arrived
in traditional attire from Singapore’s vast tapestry of cultures. We began
the day by exploring thoughtful articles on nurturing an inclusive society
and sustaining harmony through positive actions during morning reading.
In line with this, an assembly programme during CCE encouraged us to have
frank conversations about race and religion, reminding us of the importance
of embracing every community with respect.</p>
<p>The festivities contributed to the lively, celebratory spirit of the day.
A lively mini-fair organised by the Parents’ Support Group (PSG) brought
an array of nostalgic cultural snacks to the canteen, brightening up the
atmosphere. Creativity also shone through the Class Photo Competitions,
allowing each class to showcase their diversity with pride. Additionally,
the school introduced the Creative Expressions Competition this year, where
students were encouraged to submit a short story or poem with the theme
‘Harmony in Diversity’. Personally, I truly enjoyed contributing to this
as it gave me the chance to reflect on our shared history and the challenges
it took to build the socially cohesive society that we now treasure.</p>
<p>Today, we live in a uniquely Singaporean society where our diversity is
not a weakness but a strength that propels us forward. Racial Harmony Day
serves as a reminder that this virtue must <strong><u>be nurtured </u></strong>with
each passing year, bringing us closer as one people, one nation, one Singapore!</p>
