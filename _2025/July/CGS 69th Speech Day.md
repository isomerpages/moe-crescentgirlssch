<h2><strong>Crescent Girls’ School 69th Speech Day: “Past Journeys, Future Dreams”</strong></h2>
<p>Crescent Girls’ School celebrated its 69th Speech Day on 12 July 2025,
with the inspiring theme <strong>“Past Journeys, Future Dreams.”</strong> Graced
by our Guest-of-Honour, Ms Liew Geok Heok, the event was a heartfelt tribute
to the achievements of our students and staff, the legacy of the school,
and the aspirations that guide our future.</p>
<p>The day’s highlights included speeches by our Guest-of-Honour, Ms Liew
Geok Heok and our Principal, Ms Cindy Low, award presentations that recognised
the hard work and dedication of Teachers and Crescentians, and captivating
performances by our school choir and members of the Chinese and Modern
Dance group.</p>
<p>As emcees for this special occasion, we were filled with immense pride
witnessing how our fellow Crescentians represented the school with confidence,
poise, and excellence. This opportunity has taught us valuable lessons
in responsibility, adaptability, and resilience. Being on stage challenged
us to express ourselves as confident young women and effective communicators.</p>
<p>As the curtains drew to a close, a bittersweet feeling lingered. Speech
Day left us with cherished memories, meaningful lessons, and renewed motivation.
It reminded us that while we honour the past, we must also look ahead —
with hope, determination, and belief that the best is yet to come.</p>
<p>With hearts full of gratitude and dreams in our sights, we will continue
striving for excellence and working towards a future where no goal is out
of reach.</p>
