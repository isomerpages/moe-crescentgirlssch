<h3>Hari Raya Celebration @ CGS</h3>
<p>Crescent celebrated Hari Raya with a vibrant and memorable concert that
brought the school community together in joyous festivity. The celebration
began with a grand entrance by our principal and vice principals, who arrived
in stylish <em>baju kurung</em>, setting the tone for the day. We were then
treated to a graceful dance performance by Permata Seni Budaya, a Singaporean
Malay dance group. Dressed in stunning traditional attire, the dancers
glided across the stage with smooth, practiced movements.</p>
<p>Following that was an engaging educational segment by our student emcees,
who shared interesting facts about Hari Raya, including proper visiting
etiquette and cultural traditions. The excitement continued with a lively
Kompang performance by Kompang Ariqin, which truly energized the crowd.
Students were thrilled when the performers invited volunteers — including
a few teachers — to try their hand at playing the drums.</p>
<p>The emcees then hosted a fun quiz segment with prizes for students who
answered Hari Raya trivia correctly. The celebration concluded on a high
note with a spirited sing-along led by the Secondary 4 students.</p>
<p>This event aimed to educate Crescentians about Muslim culture by highlighting
one of its most significant celebrations. In a multicultural society like
Singapore, it is important to recognize and appreciate the richness of
all communities. Judging by the enthusiastic conversations I heard, with
students eagerly sharing their customs with their non-Muslim friends, I
believe the event fulfilled its purpose beautifully.</p>
