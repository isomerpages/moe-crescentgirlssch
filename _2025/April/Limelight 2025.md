<p>On 29 April 2025, the Crescent Girls’ School Symphonic Band (CGSSB) had
the honour of performing our 13th <strong>Limelight</strong> concert at the
Esplanade Concert Hall. This esteemed concert series showcases some of
Singapore’s finest school choirs and symphonic bands, providing a prestigious
platform for young musicians to share their talents with a wider audience.
Limelight aims to promote musical excellence in schools, and we were proud
to once again be a part of it.</p>
<p>In the weeks leading up to the performance, we committed ourselves to
intensive rehearsals. Our goal was clear—to deliver a performance that
reflected not only our hard work and dedication, but also to make our families,
friends, and school community proud. As the concert day approached, a mixture
of excitement and nerves filled the air. For many of us, it was our first
time performing in front of a live audience in quite some time, and with
a large number of tickets sold, the pressure to excel was palpable.</p>
<p>Despite our nerves, the unwavering support and guidance from our teachers
and conductors gave us the confidence to perform with conviction. Their
encouragement helped us overcome our anxieties and focus on the music.</p>
<p>By the end of the concert, we were filled with pride and gratitude. Performing
at Limelight was a deeply rewarding experience that allowed us to showcase
CGSSB’s musical growth and unity. It was a night we will always remember—one
that celebrated our journey and reaffirmed our love for music.</p>
