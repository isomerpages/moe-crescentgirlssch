<p>The Crescent Sports Carnival was a vibrant celebration of school spirit,
camaraderie, and friendly competition. Held on a bright and sunny morning
at Bukit Gombak Stadium, the event brought together students and teachers
for a day filled with exhilarating races and engaging fringe activities.</p>
<p>The highlight of the carnival was the series of inter-class, inter-CCA,
and inter-house races. Participants showcased not only their athletic talent
but also strong teamwork, as they competed fiercely to earn points and
pride for their respective groups. Adding to the excitement was a special
race featuring teachers, which drew loud cheers and laughter from the crowd.
Students enthusiastically supported their favourite teachers, who demonstrated
great energy, enthusiasm, and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>Beyond the track, a variety of fringe activities were set up on the surrounding
grass patches. These mini-games offered students additional opportunities
to contribute points to their houses in a fun and relaxed setting.</p>
<p>A standout moment of the day was the mascot race. Each of the five houses
was represented by a creatively designed mascot, crafted by the Secondary
2 house leaders using recycled materials. The mascots not only raced but
were also judged based on their design and creativity, adding a unique
and eco-friendly twist to the event.</p>
<p>The Sports Carnival successfully fostered a sense of unity, healthy competition,
and school pride. It was a truly memorable occasion that left everyone
with smiles, laughter, and lasting memories.</p>
