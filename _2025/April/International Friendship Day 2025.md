<p>On April 11th, Crescent Girls’ School celebrated International Friendship
Day (IFD) with a series of meaningful activities aimed at highlighting
the importance of racial harmony and cultural appreciation.</p>
<p>To bring the event to life, the school formed dedicated teams to plan
and execute the celebrations. The Content Team focused on researching various
cultures and creating informative, engaging slides to raise awareness among
the students about the richness of diversity and the value of friendship.
Meanwhile, the Games Team was in charge of crafting fun and interactive
activities. From Bingo games to creative videos, their contributions helped
make the celebration lively and inclusive, ensuring that students not only
learned about different cultures but enjoyed the process too.</p>
<p>One everyday example of how Crescent embraces diversity is through its <strong>canteen</strong>,
where food stalls offer a variety of dishes from different cultures. This
simple initiative allows students to explore and appreciate different cuisines,
fostering inclusiveness and normalising cultural diversity in daily life.</p>
<p>Living in Singapore means being part of a vibrant, multicultural society—a
unique blend of races, religions, and traditions. As our National Pledge
reminds us, “regardless of race, language or religion,” we stand united
as one people. This spirit is at the heart of International Friendship
Day.</p>
<p>Crescentians continue to embrace their differences, celebrate friendships,
and build a world that’s more connected, compassionate, and inclusive—on
International Friendship Day and every day.</p>
