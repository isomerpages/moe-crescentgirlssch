<p><strong>Hosting of Cau Giay Secondary School</strong>
</p>
<p>On 15 October, Crescent Girls’ School had the privilege of welcoming students
and teachers from Cau Giay Secondary School in Vietnam. This visit marked
the continuation of a cultural exchange that began earlier in May, when
Crescent students travelled to Hanoi to visit Cau Giay.</p>
<p>The reciprocal exchange deepened cross-cultural understanding and strengthened
the bonds of friendship between the two schools. It offered meaningful
opportunities for students and teachers to share their school cultures,
learning environments, and core values. Through collaboration and dialogue,
students from both schools gained a deeper appreciation of the similarities
and differences that shape their educational experiences.</p>
<p>The exchange also underscored the importance of openness, empathy, and
respect in building genuine international connections that transcend language
and cultural boundaries. Hosting the Cau Giay delegation encouraged Crescentians
to reflect on their own school identity and the values that define their
community.</p>
<p>Through cultural sharing sessions and performance showcases, participants
from both schools broadened their perspectives on education and global
citizenship. The visit exemplified how intercultural experiences can enrich
personal growth and foster mutual understanding beyond the classroom.</p>
<p>Overall, the Crescent–Cau Giay exchange stands as a testament to the power
of collaboration, friendship, and shared learning in education.</p>
