<h3><strong>Champion Seminar: Into the Mind of Riley.</strong></h3>
<p>The Champion Seminar, held on 13 August, began in an imaginative and engaging
way—by miniaturising us and transporting us into the mind of Riley, a new
student facing the monumental task of choosing two CCAs to join. In the
story, these two choices would become Riley’s final CCA selections—but
in real life, they symbolised the two CCAs that would eventually be crowned
“CCAs of the Year.”</p>
<p>Riley, overwhelmed by the many options and frustrated by her parents’
constant probing, eventually loses her temper and shuts them out. In response
to her emotional outburst, a loud rumble erupts and the four joyful CCA
"islands"—Sports, Performing Arts, Clubs &amp; Societies, and Uniformed
Groups—begin to malfunction.</p>
<p>As the story unfolds, Riley’s emotions work together with the CCA leaders
to restore power to the islands. Through this journey, Riley revisits her
positive memories of the CCAs, helping her gain clarity and confidence
in making her decision.</p>
<p>The emotional climax came when Riley’s imaginary friend, Bing Bong, made
a selfless sacrifice to help them return to headquarters. This touching
moment served as a metaphor for the often-unseen sacrifices made by CCA
coaches and teachers—their time, effort, and unwavering dedication to their
students. At this poignant point in the programme, CCA leaders moved around
the hall to personally present tokens of appreciation to their CCA teachers
and instructors, acknowledging their invaluable support.</p>
<p>Overall, the Champion Seminar was both energising and inspiring. It reminded
every CCA of the passion, perseverance, and teamwork that drive their success—and
encouraged them to continue striving for excellence, both individually
and as a team.</p>
