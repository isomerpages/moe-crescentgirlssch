<p><strong>Secondary 2 Showcase</strong>
</p>
<p>Our experience during the Secondary Two Showcase held on 1 August was
truly memorable. Besides strengthening our class bond, it gave us the opportunity
to share our journey as Crescentians with our parents and reflect on how
it has shaped our growth.</p>
<p>Our class was divided into groups to present different aspects of Crescent
life. To kick things off, we showcased how Crescent integrates various
subjects to make learning more engaging and meaningful. For instance, in
Secondary Two, we completed a project that combined Art, History, and English,
helping us see how subjects connect across disciplines. We also shared
how our Computer Education programmes encouraged us to explore new apps
and even try our hand at coding. These presentations demonstrated that
learning at Crescent goes beyond individual subjects, equipping us with
versatile skills for the future.</p>
<p>The second part of the showcase focused on our growth as a class. From
our class party to the inter-class basketball competition, we highlighted
the effort everyone made to ensure our events were inclusive and fun—experiences
that brought us closer together. We also spoke about how Crescent encourages
us to lead, serve, and give back to the community through various leadership
opportunities. Many parents were particularly interested in the different
leadership groups and how they help to sustain the Crescentian spirit.</p>
<p>After the presentations, we moved on to the World Café, where parents
explored booths about our Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs). They chatted
with students, admired our displays, and looked through pictures showcasing
our CCA experiences. Some even joined in the fun by participating in game
stalls and winning small prizes, adding a lively and interactive element
to the event.</p>
<p>My favourite part of the showcase was the finale: our class performance
of the Cup Song. At first, many of us were out of sync and a little shy.
But once we realised the performance symbolised our class spirit, we worked
hard to perfect the rhythm. It was heartwarming to see classmates teaching
each other the beats and offering encouragement. Although the performance
wasn’t perfect, our energy and teamwork got the parents clapping and singing
along. That moment truly captured how far we’d come as a class.</p>
<p>Overall, the Secondary Two Showcase gave us the chance to reflect on our
journey, celebrate our achievements, and show our parents how Crescent
has nurtured us into the ladies and leaders of tomorrow. Most importantly,
it reminded us of the joy of being part of our class—and of being proud
Crescentians.</p>
