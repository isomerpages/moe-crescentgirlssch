*   It comes with smooth inking with Apple Pencil.
*   It has many educational apps available in iOS app store for T&amp;L.
*   Apple Classroom allows teachers to better monitor, control and share resources with students during lessons.

Parents are given the flexibility and autonomy, through Option 2 and 3, to choose the most suitable model of iPad for their daughter if it is compatible with the MOE Device Management Application (DMA) and the apps for teaching and learning in school.

#### **Option 1: MOE iPad Bundle**
The school has made arrangements for you to purchase the PLD from AsiaPac Distribution Pte. Ltd. (Vendor) for your child’s/ward’s use in school. The vendor has been identified based on the choice of device determined by the school from a panel of awarded suppliers established by MOE. The PLD bundle which includes warranty and insurance for purchase by your child/ward will be:
