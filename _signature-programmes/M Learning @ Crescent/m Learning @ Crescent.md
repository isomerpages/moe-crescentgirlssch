### **m-Learning@Crescent**
At Crescent, we have a tradition of seeking excellence in teaching and learning through innovation, one of the core drivers of a Crescentian education. Recognising the potential of a 1-to-1 computing experience and the unique possibilities of personal learning device (PLD) offers in providing a richer teaching and learning experience, Crescent Girls' School embarked on m-Learning@Crescent in 2004. In March 2020, MOE launched the National Digital Literacy Programme (NDLP) for secondary schools and Institutes of Higher Learning to help students strengthen their digital literacy. One of the components of the NDLP is the introduction of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) for all secondary school students, whereby every secondary school student will own a school-prescribed Personal Learning Device (PLD) by end-2021. Crescent was selected as one of the Phase 1 schools in PDLP and has since aligned the m-Learning @ Crescent programme with the NDLP and PDLP.

All 1000 students at Crescent Girls' School own a PLD each. Outfitted with the latest Microsoft productivity apps, multimedia editing apps, and a wide range of education applications like micro:bit and Math VR, students can harness technologies effectively to enhance their learning.

This is made possible through the effective integration of ICT into our curriculum, pedagogy and assessment delivered via uniquely designed lessons by our teachers. The design of ICT-enriched learning experiences provides opportunities for students to engage in collaborative learning, research, problem-solving and creative activities, thus helping them achieve their subject learning goals and acquire crucial 21st Century Competencies.

Tapping on the campus-wide wireless network, all staff and students are interconnected wirelessly, enabling greater collaboration, and sharing. Onsite helpdesk is available for quick troubleshooting and repair of PLDs. Personal reinforced lockers in the classrooms also allow PLDs to be stored securely.

All Secondary One and Two students at Crescent Girls' School go through the Lower Secondary Computer Education Programme (LSCEP) to enable students to acquire digital skills and apply these skills as they navigate an increasingly digitalised world. A structured Cyber Wellness programme is also put in place to ensure that students have the correct attitude and mindset when using such technologies. 

Through its journey as one of the pioneering schools in harnessing ICT for teaching and learning, Crescent Girls' School has been awarded various accolades. In 2004, the Ministry of Education selected Crescent Girls' School as one of the Backpack.NET schools. In 2006, Microsoft named the school one of its Mentor Schools under its worldwide Partners in Learning programme. In 2007, Crescent Girls' School was named by the Ministry of Education as a pioneer FutureSchools@Singapore.
