<h3><strong>Values in Action</strong></h3>
<p>At Crescent Girls' School, we seamlessly integrate Character &amp; Citizenship
Education (CCE) into both our formal and informal curriculum through a
structured and holistic framework. One key component of CCE within our
formal curriculum is the <strong>Values in Action (VIA) programme</strong>,
a vital part of the Student Development Experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>VIA encourages students to actively engage in problem-solving and community
service, empowering them to become responsible and compassionate citizens
who contribute meaningfully to society. Throughout the programme, students
identify areas of concern, assess the needs of their chosen community,
and design and implement practical solutions. The projects culminate in
collective action, creating a positive impact on the communities they serve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to fostering a sense of social responsibility, VIA helps students
develop essential skills such as <strong>information literacy, communication, and collaboration</strong>.
To further enhance teamwork and self-awareness, students participate in
the DISC personality profiling assessment, which allows them to better
understand their strengths and areas for growth, resulting in more effective
group work and project outcomes. The skills learned through VIA are transferable
and are applied across Crescent’s broader curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The VIA programme evolves as students progress through the school. <strong>Lower Secondary</strong> students
focus on raising awareness and advocating for change, building foundational
problem-solving skills. <strong>Upper Secondary</strong> students, on the
other hand, take a more self-directed approach by initiating projects that
apply their knowledge to real-world community needs. A highlight of this
progression is the <strong>Secondary Three VIA project</strong>, which integrates
Social Studies using an inquiry-based approach. This project helps deepen
students’ understanding of civic literacy while addressing important community
issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through VIA, Crescent Girls' School equips students with the competencies
and values necessary to become active, informed citizens who make a lasting
difference in their communities.&nbsp;</p>
