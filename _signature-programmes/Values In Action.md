### **Values in Action**
In Crescent Girls' School, CCE (Character &amp; Citizenship Education) is infused in both the formal and informal curriculum through a structured CCE framework. One example of CCE in the formal curriculum is the Crescent's Values in Action (ViA) programme. This programme engages our lower secondary students in a dynamic problem-solving process, encouraging them to make a difference in the community. The programme is closely aligned with the school's core values which are encapsulated in the C-DIET framework.

As part of the ViA curriculum, the lower secondary students take the initiative to find areas of concern and formulate solutions to address them. Students first embark on a needs identification process, which involves conducting surveys and interviews. Upon identifying the actual needs of the target community, students are given the opportunity to propose feasible and manageable solutions through establishing criteria, prioritisation, evaluation, and finally making decisions. Students then present their project plans to their classmates, with each class then selecting the best project to implement. The ViA projects culminate in collective action that makes a difference to the target community.

Through the ViA process, students acquire essential competencies such as information literacy, communication and collaboration. To help the students acquire greater self-awareness and learn to work collaboratively, a professional profiling instrument (DISC) is utilised to help students understand their personality, strengths and weaknesses, leading to improved group processes and outcomes. The skills and competencies that students acquire in this ViA process are also transferred to other areas in the holistic curriculum.

With the Secondary One students focusing on "Awareness and Advocacy", we establish basic problem-solving principles. The Secondary Two ViA then encourages the students to put this knowledge and skills into action to address community needs. The school is poised to work with Tanglin-Cairnhill Constituency Office to provide students with authentic platforms for their ViA projects.
