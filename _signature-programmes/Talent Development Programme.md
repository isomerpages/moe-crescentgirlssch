**A real-world problem solver,**<br>
A TDP Crescentian will be challenged to investigate real-world problems and provide feasible actions for change.&nbsp; They will be guided through a research process through speaking with academic and industrial experts and readings. Through her research work, she will be exposed to high levels of abstract thinking, verbal and numerical reasoning, spatial relations, memory, and word fluency. She should be able to adapt to and shape novel situations encountered in an external environment outside the school.

**A creative and inventive thinker and**<br>
A TDP Crescentian with high levels of creativity should possess fluency, flexibility and originality of thought. She would be receptive to new experiences, thoughts and actions of self and others. There should be curiosity, a sense of speculation and a willingness to take calculated risks in thoughts and actions. Finally, she will be sensitive to details and have an aesthetic appreciation of ideas and objects.

**A passionate change-agent.**<br>
A TDP Crescentian with high task commitment will exhibit a high level of interest and involvement in a particular problem or area of study. She will have a high capacity for perseverance, determination, hard work, and dedicated practice to see through the research process and work towards proposing changes to give back to society.

**Secondary 2 Innovation Programme (IVP) by MOE, GEB.**<br>
Our Secondary 2 TDP Crescentians actively participated in an Innovation programme organised by MOE Gifted Education Branch. This initiative empowered our students to generate creative ideas and develop innovative products centered around themes like inclusivity, sustainability, and supporting students from low-income families.

During the programme, students honed their problem-solving and inventive skills, engaged in practical problem-solving scenarios, and gained exposure to knowledge and experiences beyond the classroom by interacting with innovation mentors from tertiary institutions and other organisations. Regular IvP lessons, mentoring sessions by teacher mentors and peer feedback further enriched their learning.

Students had the opportunity to connect with Innovation Mentors from partner institutions, who provided invaluable advice and insights based on their expertise to enhance the quality of the projects. In 2022, the Tong Gripper project was not only selected for the Online Judging Final but also featured on the Young Innovators' Fair website.

In 2023, the success continued as three projects, Joyful Journal, GoGreen Away with Pens and &nbsp;Stress Away with Cashier, were chosen to collaborate further with innovation mentors. Throughout the program, our students showcased resilience in overcoming challenges and demonstrated a hands-on approach to creating products that contribute positively to the community.

**Secondary Three Community Change Agents**

Our Secondary 3 TDP experience centers around the pursuit of sustainability as we inculcate in our students, the value of knowledge for agents of change. We build upon our experiences in our Secondary 2 programme, introducing new core ideas in the research process. These include the formulation and refinement of hypotheses, through various research methods like observations, surveys and interviews.

Our programme is supplemented by our sessions with selected guest speakers sharing their expertise and experiences. Through these sessions, we gain valuable insights from the perspectives of multiple stakeholders in the issues we are aiming to tackle.

In a key highlight of our programme, our Overseas Study Trip, we offer opportunities to practise our research skills through our hands-on fieldwork experience. These are further enriched by the exposure to new perspectives, and new ways of understanding existing issues at hand.

These experiences then culminate in our project presentations, where we share our findings on the key challenges our society faces, and the roles that key stakeholders can play in overcoming them.
