### **21st Century Competencies**
At Crescent, we recognise the critical need to develop 21st Century skills and proficiencies in our students to help them succeed in a diverse, global, complex and media-saturated society. Our interdisciplinary, integrated and project-based curriculum is designed to provide opportunities for the development and mastery of the following 21st Century Competencies in our students:
*   Collaboration
*   Global Awareness
*   Knowledge Construction
*   Real-World Problem-Solving and Innovation
*   Skilled Communication
*   Use of ICT for Learning

Co-curricular participation cultivates the following 21st Century Competencies in our students, as well as recognise exemplary conduct and active contribution:
*   Self-regulation
*   Leadership
*   Social Skills

It is hopedÂ that most Crescentians will attain the 5-6 range in the scoring metrics for each skill before they leave the school. Students will receive assessment feedback indicating the level attained for each assessed competency over the year.
