### **Music Elective Programme**
The Music Elective Programme (MEP) is a four-year talent programme that prepares students for the G3 Higher Music examination.

The objective of the MEP is to provide opportunities for musically-inclined students to pursue their passion and cultivate their abilities in music-writing, music-making and music listening.

Students selected for the programme will take Music (MEP) instead of Design &amp; Technology and Food &amp; Consumer Education at the lower secondary level.

Sec 1 Students (from 2024) will be preparing for the equivalent of the GCE 'O' Level Higher Music at the end of their Secondary School Education.

The current GCE 'O' Level Higher Music Syllabus (6086) is available for download at SEAB website [http://www.seab.gov.sg](http://www.seab.gov.sg)

To qualify for MEP@CGS, the student must have fulfilled the following:

*   She is proficient at playing at least one musical instrument at novice to intermediate level.
*   She has rudimentary music theory knowledge and can read, write and notate music in the Western music tradition.

Apart from satisfying the above prerequisites, all potential students must meet the requirements at a compulsory written-cum-performance audition.

The compulsory audition will require the applicant to present Two Contrasting pieces of her choice that would best demonstrate her musical abilities. The written test will determine her aural skills and musical content knowledge. Applicants who are not performing on the Piano must make their own provision/arrangements to present on the instrument of their choice. All performance auditions should be unaccompanied.
