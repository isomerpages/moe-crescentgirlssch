### **Integrated Curriculum**
#### **About the Curriculum**
The Integrated Curriculum, or IC for short is a dynamic method of teaching where content, skills, and ideas seamlessly weave together from various subject areas to delve into specific themes and topics.&nbsp; At Crescent Girls’ School, our students would be engaged in various integrative studies, using various models of integration based on core themes.&nbsp; As Minister Chan Chun Sing, Minister of Education aptly put it in his speech at the Virtual Singapore Teaching and Academic Research Talent Scheme (START) Award Ceremony in 2021,

Through our 3-year Integrated Curriculum Programme, students are engaged in investigating authentic real-world issues through the lenses of different disciplines in order to gain a better understanding of the issues at hand and explore and / or recommend possible solutions.&nbsp; We hope that through these studies, our students would be able to:

* Understand the interconnectedness among different subjects and disciplines;
* Apply knowledge and skills from different subjects to handle authentic performance tasks;
* Collaborate and co-construct knowledge effectively with their peers at the various stages of the curriculum;
* Harness Information &amp; communication technology (ICT) effectively to handle their performance tasks;
* Strengthen their global awareness to be better equipped as citizens of the 21st century.



**Secondary One Integrated Curriculum (IC)**<br>
**Focus Subjects: Science and Geography**<br>
**Theme: Water Scarcity**<br>
**21CC Skills: Global Awareness, Real-World Problem Solving**<br>

As part of the Secondary One IC, students explore the theme of water scarcity through the lenses of Geography and Science.&nbsp; In Geography, students explore the issue of global water crisis and water management strategies.&nbsp; Through their geographical investigation, they would focus on investigating the impact of human on water qualities and acquire water quality testing techniques. They extend their learning by exploring the various separation techniques in Science to devise methods in obtaining clean water in both laboratory and home-based settings, by understanding the factors that would influence the choices of separation techniques. The coursework and hands-on activities provide the students with enriching inter-disciplinary learning experiences about sustainability of our precious resources.

**Secondary Two Integrated Curriculum**<br>
**Focus Subjects:&nbsp; Art, English Language and History**<br>
**Theme:&nbsp; Power**<br>
**21CC Skill:&nbsp; Global Awareness, Skilled Communication (Verbal and Visual)**<br>

In Secondary 2, students embark on an exciting academic journey that fuses the worlds of Art, English Language, and History, all centered around the captivating theme of 'Power'. This unique educational experience fosters a deep understanding of how these three seemingly distinct subjects interconnect, allowing students to grasp the underlying unity of knowledge while still mastering the intricacies of each individual discipline.

In the Art component, students explore the principles of design, using these foundational concepts to dissect sources and craft innovative creations. In the realm of English Language, the study of Semiotic Modes empowers students to decode and comprehend artifacts with greater depth and insight. History delves into the political developments of post-WWII, offering a crucial backdrop for students to make sense of the presented artifacts. The synergy across these subjects is illuminated as students embark on an inspiring learning journey to the National Art Gallery. Here, they apply their knowledge and skills to analyze and appreciate diverse art pieces, witnessing how the overarching theme of 'Power' resonates through the lenses of Art, English, and History. To culminate this enriching experience, students collaborate in groups to recreate their version of an artifact from the 1959 General Elections period. This hands-on project brings a profound sense of purpose and meaning to their learning journey, as they dive deeper into the theme of 'Power' and create their historical artifacts.

**Secondary Three Integrated Curriculum**<br>
**Focus Subjects:&nbsp; English Language, Mathematics and Social Studies**<br>
**Theme:&nbsp; Governance**<br>
**21CC Skill:&nbsp; Global Awareness, Real-World Problem Solving, Skilled Communication**<br>

Secondary Three Integrated Curriculum (IC) challenges students to consider whose responsibility it is when working for the good of the society. The disciplines involved are English Language, Social Studies, and Mathematics and students work in groups to address four social issues related to transport, aging population, healthcare and integration efforts.

In the English Language module, students learn how to speak with expression and fluency using a combination of semiotic modes, namely linguistic and gestural. They are then assessed in terms of the 21st competency – Skilled Communication.&nbsp; In the Social Studies module, students learn how to perform research or use the learning content from their social studies lessons for the Crez Model Cabinet. They are assessed in terms of Global Awareness.&nbsp; In the Mathematics module, students learn how to apply statistics in real life situations after analysis and interpretation. They are assessed in terms of Real World Problem Solving &amp; Innovation.

IC culminates in students writing a group commentary article that puts forth recommendations for their assigned social issue.

Our Integrated Curriculum, engaging, and intellectually stimulating, empowers students to think critically, connect the dots between subjects, and actively apply their knowledge to the real world. Beyond this, IC equips students with the invaluable ability to apply their newfound skills and concepts in real-life situations.&nbsp; Listen to our Alumni student who had benefitted from the 3-year IC programme.
