#### **About the Curriculum**
The Integrated Curriculum, or IC for short is a dynamic method of teaching where content, skills, and ideas seamlessly weave together from various subject areas to delve into specific themes and topics.&nbsp; At Crescent Girls’ School, our students would be engaged in various integrative studies, using various models of integration based on core themes.&nbsp; As Minister Chan Chun Sing, Minister of Education aptly put it in his speech at the Virtual Singapore Teaching and Academic Research Talent Scheme (START) Award Ceremony in 2021,

Through our 3-year Integrated Curriculum Programme, students are engaged in investigating authentic real-world issues through the lenses of different disciplines in order to gain a better understanding of the issues at hand and explore and / or recommend possible solutions.&nbsp; We hope that through these studies, our students would be able to:

* Understand the interconnectedness among different subjects and disciplines;
* Apply knowledge and skills from different subjects to handle authentic performance tasks;
* Collaborate and co-construct knowledge effectively with their peers at the various stages of the curriculum;
* Harness Information &amp; communication technology (ICT) effectively to handle their performance tasks;
* Strengthen their global awareness to be better equipped as citizens of the 21st century.



**Secondary One Integrated Curriculum (IC)**<br>
**Focus Subjects:&nbsp; Science and Geography**<br>
**Theme:&nbsp; Water Scarcity**<br>
**21CC Skills:&nbsp; Global Awareness, Real-World Problem Solving**<br>

As part of the Secondary One IC, students explore the theme of water scarcity through the lenses of Geography and Science.&nbsp; In Geography, students explore the issue of global water crisis and water management strategies.&nbsp; Through their geographical investigation, they would focus on investigating the impact of human on water qualities and acquire water quality testing techniques. They extend their learning by exploring the various separation techniques in Science to devise methods in obtaining clean water in both laboratory and home-based settings, by understanding the factors that would influence the choices of separation techniques. The coursework and hands-on activities provide the students with enriching inter-disciplinary learning experiences about sustainability of our precious resources.
