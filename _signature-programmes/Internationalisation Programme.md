### Internationalisation Programme
The main objectives of the Internationalisation Programme are:
*   To develop students to be culturally savvy;
*   To expose students to the world beyond Singapore;
*   To develop compassion in students as they participate in international service-learning.

Secondary 2 Students will have the opportunity to visit one of the following destinations: India (Jaipur), China (Changsha), China (Xi'an), Laos (Luang Prabang), Thailand (Chiangmai), Malaysia (Malacca), Vietnam (Hanoi) or Indonesia (Bintan).

The trip itinerary will generally include 2 components:<br>
1\. Service Learning<br>
2\. Cultural Immersion

After the trip, students felt that they should appreciate what they have in Singapore and learn how to rise above challenges. They feel a sense of rootedness towards Singapore after they have been to these countries.\[TZX3\]
