Guidelines on Parents’ Communication with the School

<img src="/images/guidelines.jpg" style="width:75%">

1\. Crescent Girls’ School’s official modes of communication with parents are:
* School phone: 6475 8711 (General Office)
* School email: crescentgirl@moe.edu.sg
* School mailing address: 357, Tanglin Road, S247961
* Staff official school email addresses:  @crescent.edu.sg or @schools.gov.sg
* School website: www.crescent.edu.sg 
* Students’ Handbook: hard copy issued yearly to each student

2\. Parents should limit all communication with teachers to term time and school hours: phone calls or meetings with teachers should be within school hours (7.30am-6.00pm) on working weekdays during term time (ie Week 1 – Week 10).

3\.	For urgent messages to teachers, parents may contact the school General Office, if teachers are in class or uncontactable during school hours.

4\.	Teachers are not expected to respond to parents’ and students’ queries after school hours, during weekends and school holidays.

5\.	Teachers are not expected to provide their personal mobile numbers to parents or students. Teachers are also not required to communicate via social media (e.g. Whatsapp or Facebook). 

6\.	Face-to-face meetings with teachers should be arranged in advance: parents are to email the teachers or contact the General Office at least 3 days in advance, to minimise disruption to the teachers’ teaching duties.

7\.	In line with Civil Service practice, parents may expect to receive a response to their email queries within a reasonable period of time, so that our staff have sufficient time to ensure that the queries are addressed well:
* 3 working days (Simple query)
* 7 working days (Query that needs some investigation)
* 21 working days (Complex query) 

8\. The school reserves the right not to engage with any parent who is disrespectful, rude or abusive to our staff.

Note: All Civil Servants are protected by the Protection from Harassment Act (PoHA) which may be accessed [here](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/PHA2014#pr6).
