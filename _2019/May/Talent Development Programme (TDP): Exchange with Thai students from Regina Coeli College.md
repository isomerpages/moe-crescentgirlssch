### **Talent Development Programme (TDP): Exchange with Thai students from Regina Coeli College**
On the 22nd of May, 20 Thai students from Regina Coeli College (Chiang Mai, Thailand) arrived in sunny Singapore. 26 Crescentians from the Talent Development Programme (TDP) and Model United Nations (MUN) programme were tasked to buddy-up with the Thai exchange students and host them for a week. I was thrilled as this was a rare opportunity to interact with students from another country, share with them snippets of our lives in Singapore, as well as learn new things together. 

The exchange programme kicked started with a welcome dinner at Nanyang Boarding School where we all took the chance to break the ice. It was filled with good food and hearty laughs. As the week progressed, we got to know one another better as they experienced our classes and Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) together with us. We also took the Thai students to various tourist attractions, such as Marina Barrage, Gardens By The Bay, and the National Gallery, where they got to learn more about the little red dot. Amidst all of these fun and enriching activities which broadened their horizons and gave them a taste of the Singapore life, my school mates and I enjoyed ourselves very much as well! We learnt some surprising facts about Thailand, which is a country with rich culture and heritage. 

Bonds were forged and friendships were built. After a meaningful week, the dreaded last day of the programme, had arrived. With heavy hearts, we grabbed the opportunity to take many pictures and to have one last meal together. At last, with tears in everyoneâ€™s eyes, we bid farewell.   

This was definitely a week to remember. We got to learn so much beyond the regular classroom lessons and built precious friendships with the Thai students. All in all, this exchange was an unforgettable experience.
