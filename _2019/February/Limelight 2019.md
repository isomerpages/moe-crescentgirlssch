Limelight 2019 was really an eye opener for me. As a Secondary 2 band member, Limelight was my first ever performance as part of Crescent Girlsâ€™ School Symphonic Band (CGSSB). While working for Limelight, there were times when I felt like giving up, when I felt that I was not up to standard. However, my seniors as well as my batch mates never failed to lighten my spirits and guide me throughout my CGSSB journey. The week before the performance day, the whole of CGSSB made it a point to bring home our instruments so that we could practice our repertoire. The day of the performance soon arrived and despite feeling nervous, I told myself to not let my nerves get a hold of me. After much preparations, we left the school for Esplanade, Theatres by the Bay, spending hours doing last minute preparations. As time passed and the concert neared, I prepared myself for what was going to happen next. However, nothing could ever prepare me for the feeling of joy and satisfaction mixed with nervousness when I entered the stage to perform. The feeling was simply indescribable. Never once had I thought that my dreams to perform on the Esplanade Concert Hall stage could be fulfilled, yet, it was happening. I learnt how to be resilient and the importance of teamwork through limelight. I also learnt the importance of planning ahead and to give it your all for anything that you do. It has been a week after limelight, and I doubt I will ever be able to forget my experience. Not only that, I will always hold the lessons it taught me close to my heart.
