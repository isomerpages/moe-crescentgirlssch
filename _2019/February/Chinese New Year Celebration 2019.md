### **Chinese New Year Celebration 2019**
Crescent held its Chinese New Year Celebrations on 4th of February 2019. There was a festive atmosphere in the air that day and students were buzzing with excitement as they waited eagerly for celebrations to begin.&nbsp; There were so many performances, ranging from the School Choir’s performance, Jara’s melodious singing, to the energetic dances put up by the Chinese and Modern Dance CCA. One of the surprising yet entertaining performances was put up by the teachers this year.&nbsp;  
  
I would describe my experience of Chinese New Year 2019 to be a fulfilling one. As one of the emcees, I hoped from the start, that Crescentians would wholeheartedly enjoy the celebrations and the special performances put up for them.&nbsp;  
  
As I saw students streaming into the hall clad in traditional Chinese cheongsams and red shirts, I felt overwhelmed with emotions. Being a Secondary 4 student, I realised that this would be the last Chinese New Year Celebration I would be attending in Crescent, and I hoped that it would be a memory that the Sec 4 batch of 2019 would truly cherish.  
  
Overall, I felt a stronger sense of belonging to Crescent as I watched the whole school bond together. At that moment, the quote "we define family not just by blood but by people with whom we can find a common ground and a common bond" struck me. The CNY Celebrations of 2019 will be etched in my heart forever.
