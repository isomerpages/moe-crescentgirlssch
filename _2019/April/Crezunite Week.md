### **Crezunite Week**
As part of the CrezUnité week, the CrezUnité Organising Committee coordinated the Be-Yourself-Day, CrezPicnic and CrezCarnival. Coming to school on Monday was a delight as all classes dressed according to the theme of “Apps” which made the hall look like a sea of rainbow. Representatives from each class walked down our very own red carpet to showcase the App they have decided to come as. They portrayed different Apps that best represented their class. Be-Yourself-Dayn was a delightful event as it allowed Crescentians to bond together as a class. On Tuesday, we had CrezPicnic, which was held in the afternoon. Everyone prepared food and brought them to school to share with their classmates. What was more exciting is that after the picnic, there was CrezCarnival. Different game booths were set up by our Crescentians, some were, haunted house and a detective agency spy game. Crescentians also got to munch on delightful treats during the carnival such as dragon’s breath. These provided Crescentians with a fun-filled afternoon and a way to unwind with their friends. This years’ Crezunite week was certainly an enjoyable week for us!
