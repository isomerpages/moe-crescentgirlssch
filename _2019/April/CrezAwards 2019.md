### **CrezAwards 2019**
The theme for CrezAwards this year is “The Oscars”. It was held on 17 April, with the aim of showcasing budding talents among the Crescentians.

The show kicked off with a bang as our guest performers Ms. Shireen and Ms. Teo Kim Yung performed one of the Disney favourites – Go the Distance, which enthralled the audience. Our line-up of talented performers consisted of a variety of song and dance groups, as well as solo performances. The performers were Arthena and Amrita, Catastrophe, Phantoms, BAO, Jara, S &amp; W, Ksheeraja, Blackhoods, Joann, Delia, and 1&lt;30bpm. They put up a splendid show after months of dedication and hard work, and it would be an understatement to say that the audience was amazed.

During the show, the emcees also went around engaging the audience with jokes and questions, and the atmosphere of the night could not have been more electric. There was even an attempt at a 'wefie' by the emcees, with all the audience members in it!

To round off the performances, we had another rousing guest item by Mr. Jonathan Ho and Ms. Kim Chan, who performed a medley of familiar pop favourites.

The awards ceremony proceeded after that, with Joann winning 2nd runner up, Jara winning 1st runner up, and 1&lt;30bpm receiving Audience Favourite award and being crowned the Ms YouNiverse of CrezAwards 2019! S &amp; W also received a special shout-out from the judges for their jovial, innovative, and splendid performance. 

All in all, it was a night to remember for both the performers and everyone in the audience. Stay tuned for CrezAwards 2020!
