Imagine a stage where instead of students, teachers can be seen dancing, singing and acting all for the sake of the enjoyment of 1000 excitable Crescentians. Although it is a sight not often seen, that is exactly what occurred on the 9th of July 2019. The teachers of Crescent had created a script writing competition, classes were asked to write scripts related to “Servant Leadership” with the promise that teachers would perform the winning script. Out of the 26 classes we have, 20 classes had eagerly submitted their script, with a variety of characters. After much consideration, class 2C1’s script was chosen for its clear demonstration of servant leadership and engaging plotline. As promised, teachers were chosen to perform. The chosen teachers thus began their rehearsals. Despite their busy schedules, they found time in between in their various groups to rehearse. If they were too busy, they rehearsed at home, sometimes even in front of their children! The day finally arrived and many Crescentians entered into the hall, anticipating a grand performance. Assembly started like any other Tuesday afternoon, with a slight small twist; Instead of student councillors who normally did the greeting, the Level Head for Upper Secondary and overall in-charge of Student Management were cladded in the Crescentian uniform. With their hair neatly pulled back, they began what was soon to become the best Afternoon Assembly to exist. The teacher in charge of Red Cross Youth gave the command and the school song played. The rest of the afternoon was filled with joy and laughter as teachers danced to famous korean pop song “Bang Bang Bang” and sang the well-known “Say Something I’m giving up on you”. While our very own teachers, including Principal Mrs Helen Chong and Vice-Principal Ms Priya Rajan critiqued each and every performance. The last and final showstopping act of the afternoon was “Let It Go”, with a blond wig and Elsa looking dress, a group of four teachers gave us the performance of a lifetime. The acts were all well received with “Can Make It” taking away the Grand Prize for their version of “Bang Bang Bang”. All in all, Youth Day 2019 was a resounding success and one that Crescentians find difficult to forget.
