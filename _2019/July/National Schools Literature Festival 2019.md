Held in Woodlands Ring Secondary on 20 July, the National Schools Literature Festival is an annual event that celebrates Literature through drama, choral speaking, debates and writing. The event provided a platform for over a hundred schools across Singapore to share ideas on the various texts they were studying in most creative ways.

I was competing in the Debate category while my fellow school mates participated in other categories. Given 2 weeks to analyse 2 poems, our stand was to prove that poem 1 depicted a stronger sense of helplessness than poem 2. My team and I set to work as soon as we had access to the poems. We were pitted against Anglican High. It was a close fight, but we managed to rebut their points and win the round. Although I was not one of the speakers, I contributed by applying my analytical skills at finding weak points in the opponentâ€™s argument. My schoolmates did well too, with the Sec 2 drama clinching the Silver award and the Sec 4 set text teams emerging winners!

In the end, I had fun, reading and enjoying literature with others, sharing one thing in common with those that had attended this event: The passion for literature
