Every year on Racial Harmony Day, Crescentians are seen clad in their unique, one of a kind ethnic clothes and have always made it a point to take pictures with their friends. Since the school has allowed students to wear their ethnic clothes throughout the day, if one were to peek into a classroom, you would see a classroom full of students wearing their colourful ethnic clothes. In addition, the CrezAmbassadors organised a fashion parade during morning assembly. On the 19th&nbsp;of July 2019, Crescentians excitedly gathered in the hall and models strutted down the runway. The hall was quickly filled with a cacophony of applause and cheers while the background music created a sense of excitement. Winning classes were awarded with a package of gifts during the afternoon assembly programme, where external professionals came in to further educate Crescentians about Racial Harmony Day. In addition to the regularly planned fashion parade, a small group of CrezAmbassadors had also been engaged in an outreach programme with Radin Mas Primary School (RMPS).&nbsp; Over the course of two training sessions, the CrezAmbassadors acted as mentors for the primary school students and taught them the basics of organising an event. The primary school students wanted to set up booths to educate their fellow schoolmates on the different cultures in Singapore. The students were seen excitedly visiting chapteh kicking booth, pick up stick booth, and five stone booth, among others. The celebration at Radin Mas Primary School was a clear success and the students had truly learnt the meaning behind Racial Harmony Day and what it means to live in a racially diverse and peaceful society.
