### **Sec 1 Orientation Campfire**
The Sec 1 Orientation Campfire is an annual event organised by the Girl Guides to create a memorable experience for the Secondary One students to mark the end of their Orientation program. 

The theme for 2019 Orientation Campfire was, “Floraison”, which means “Flowering” in French. The most anticipated part of the evening was definitely the lighting of the campfire using a fireball dropped from a height of four storeys. The excitement was certainly palpable as students were cheering enthusiastically. As the campfire burned bright into the night, various CCA groups put up stunning performances which impressed the Secondary One students greatly. The orientation groups also performed a song and their very own group cheer which created a lively and warm atmosphere. All in all, the campfire was a huge success and I am sure that everyone enjoyed every moment of it. 

 Being one of the organizers who curated the events for the night made me realise how important it was to be alert throughout the entire campfire. It was extremely crucial to the success of the night as one mistake could delay our projected timeline for the events of the night and compromise the quality of our performance. The Guides were tasked with different roles and responsibilities in various departments. Each department had their own part to play so as to ensure the success of the campfire. Even though we encountered difficulties along the way, we had one goal in mind: to organise the best campfire that night. While there was no doubt that the experience of organizing one of the major events for the Secondary One students was challenging, seeing everyone admire the decorations and the gateway, and absorbing their enthusiastic energy certainly made the effort and experience worthwhile.
