Grad Nite 2019“Today’s Moments, Tomorrow’s Memories”. The theme for Grad Night this year truly summed up the amazing memories we secondary 4s shared these past four years. It was the perfect way to celebrate the end of all our national examinations and gave us an opportunity to spend one last night together as a class.&nbsp;As we enjoyed a seven course dinner, we were entertained by fellow Crescentians competing in “Minute To Win It” games and a lucky draw where friends received prizes like an iPad and Apple Airpods. The night was definitely one not to forget, and throughout the night, we took many photos to commemorate this special day. Even as we approached the end of the night, many of us were reluctant to leave the hall, wishing to take more pictures and spend more time with one another.&nbsp;Grad Night 2019 is definitely a culmination of the past four years we students have shared as one Crescent family.
