<p>Crescent Girls’ School (CGS) and School of Science and Technology (SST)
are proud to organise Swift Explorers Singapore (SES)!</p>
<p><em>Join us to discover the wonders of coding!</em>
</p>
<p>SES is a programme designed to empower students and teachers in the field
of app development. SES is organised using resources from Apple, with training
supported by Tinkercademy, an Apple Professional Learning Provider.</p>
<p>Through this programme, students will learn how to design an app connected
to a topic they care about. Students will hone computational thinking and
creative problem-solving skills through basic coding on the iPad. Coding
with Swift is a powerful, intuitive, and easy-to-learn programming language
which provides students with fun and engaging ways to prepare for the future.</p>
<p>SES is designed to support Student-Initiated Learning (SIL) for Primary,
Secondary, Junior College and Millenia Institute students. Accompanying
teachers may also attend similar coding and app development workshops.</p>
<p>In addition, selected participants will have an opportunity to engage
with real-world developers, build their app, and showcase their work to
industry leaders.</p>
<p>The programme is free for all public education institutions to participate.</p>

<h4><strong>Programmes</strong></h4>
<p>We are pleased to introduce the programme with two engaging challenges:</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>App Design Challenge</strong>: Led by Crescent Girls' School (CGS),
this challenge focuses on design thinking and basic coding with Swift Playgrounds
on the iPad. Participants will create innovative and user-friendly apps
that solve real-world problems.</p>
<p><strong>App Development Challenge</strong>: Headed by School of Science
and Technology (SST), Singapore, this challenge dives deeper into the technical
aspects of app development. Participants will build utility apps with cutting-edge
technologies like Augmented Reality (AR) and Machine Learning (Core ML),
all with Swift Playgrounds on the iPad.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are two main modes of learning:</p>
