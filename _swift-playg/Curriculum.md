<p>This year we are excited to launch the programme with a brand-new curriculum
and two exciting challenges:</p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<h3><strong>App Design Challenge (26 hours of Workshop and SIL Activities)</strong></h3>
<p>Led by Crescent Girls' School, this challenge focuses on design thinking
and basic coding with Swift Playgrounds on the iPad. Participants will
create innovative and user-friendly apps that solve real-world problems.</p>
<h4><strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Great apps start with great ideas.</strong></h4>
<p>Students will come up with an app idea connected to a topic they care
about, then discover how to design with inclusion and accessibility as
a centerpiece of their app design.</p>
<p>The SLS package with various activities and resources will be shared with
the Teacher Coding Champions. Thereafter, the lesson materials will be
shared with the participating teams by the Teacher Coding Champions.</p>
<p>Participating students are expected to complete the activities in SLS
on inclusive app design, to learn about basic app design principles and
how to design with users’ needs in mind.</p>
<p>Students will be required to prepare a Keynote presentation and poster
for submission in SLS. Templates for the Keynote presentation will be provided
to schools to guide students in their preparation for the submission.</p>
<p>Teachers are encouraged to guide their students while leveraging on the
lesson guides and videos in the SLS.</p>
<p>Each participating school will nominate a maximum of two top entries for
the selection panel’s consideration. Selected entries will be invited to
showcase their app ideas at the celebration event held at Crescent Girls’
School.</p>
<p>Deliverables: Keynote app prototype and presentation poster of app idea</p>
<p>Outline of activities in SLS</p>

<h4><strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>App Development Challenge</strong> <strong>(26 hours of Workshop and SIL Activities)</strong></h4>
<p>Headed by School of Science and Technology, Singapore, this challenge
dives deeper into the technical aspects of app development. Participants
will build utility apps with cutting-edge technologies like Augmented Reality
(AR) and Machine Learning (Core ML), all with Swift Playgrounds on the
iPad.</p>
<p>The SLS package with various activities and resources will be shared with
the Teacher Coding Champions. Thereafter, the lesson materials will be
shared with the participating teams by the Teacher Coding Champions.</p>
<p>Participating students are expected to complete the activities in SLS
on app development.</p>
<p>Students will be required to develop an app prototype in Swift Playgrounds
and prepare a poster for submission in SLS. Templates for the poster presentation
will be provided to schools to guide students in their preparations for
the submission.</p>
<p>Teachers are encouraged to guide their students while leveraging the lesson
guides and videos in the SLS.</p>
<p>Each participating school will nominate a maximum of 2 best apps for the
selection panel’s consideration. Selected entries will be invited to showcase
their app prototypes at the celebration event held at Crescent Girls’ School.</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Deliverables: Students will submit their app prototype as well as the poster of their app.</em>
