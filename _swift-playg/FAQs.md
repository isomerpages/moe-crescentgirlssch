<h4>1. How will SES benefit my school</h4>
<p>This programme has many hands-on sessions help make coding accessible
to students and teachers alike. It mostly utilises the Student Initiated
Learning (SIL) hours to foster self-directed learners, develop students’
computational thinking and creative problem solving through basic coding
on the iPad. It is a perfect opportunity for the students to learn design-thinking
principles and other skills high sought for in the digital marketplace.</p>
<p>Participants can also gain e-certificates and CCA points if they have
performed well in the SES. Accompanying teachers, Teacher Coding Champions
(TCC), can also attain Professional Learning certificates upon completion
of SES coding workshops.</p>
