<h2><strong>HOUSE LEADERS</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“5 COLOURS, 1 CRESCENT FAMILY”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Crescent House system consists of five different houses, namely Bronte,
Curie, Fry, Keller and Pankhurst. The five houses participate in the annual
Crescent House Challenge, competing in various competitions to accumulate
points. It was designed to unite the houses in a competitive yet fun and
engaging way, taking advantage of athletic and artistic components to enhance
cohesion. It nurtures the students’ potential, ultimately bringing about
a harmonious realm of school spirit. The house which earns the most points
throughout the course of the year is awarded the title of ‘CHAMPION HOUSE’
for its efforts.</p>
<p>The Crescent House organises not only sporting events such as the biennial
Cross Country and Sports Carnival but also other events such as Champion
Seminar, an event in which House takes great pride. It serves to congratulate
and recognise students' efforts in bringing glory to the school.</p>
<p>To most Crescentians, House is the school spirit. Tuesday mornings at
the Alexandra Canal are never quiet with the loud, booming voices of House
Leaders constantly encouraging and cheering their schoolmates on during
the weekly FITT Runs. Of course, we can’t forget FITT aerobics, which is
also very much loved by the Crescentians as they sing along to the latest
hits while exercising.</p>
<p>We are also easily identified by the brightly coloured house shirts each
of the five houses, Bronte, Curie, Fry, Keller and last but not least,
Pankhurst. Each of these houses is named after inspirational women who
have made a difference in this world; Bronte, named after The Bronte Sisters,
Curie, after Marie Curie, Fry after Elizabeth Fry, Keller named after Helen
Keller and Pankhurst named after Emmeline Pankhurst. Naming each house
after motivational women serves as an inspiration to all Crescentians,
encouraging them to follow in their footsteps to become our very own influential
Ladies and Leaders of tomorrow.</p>

<p>Being involved in HOUSE has been an incredible experience! It has given
me the opportunity to build new friendships and enhance my leadership skills
while participating in events like the Champion Seminar. The bond with
my housemates has created a sense of family, making every moment in HOUSE
both rewarding and unforgettable! <strong><em>-Avisha (2G2) (Curie)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Joining House has allowed me to forge strong bonds with my fellow House
mates. We work hard, and play harder. Planning for events such as Champion
Seminar, we put in our maximum effort, and get pushed to our breaking points,
allowing us to grow more resilient and innovative. We become more confident,
driven, and responsible. I have had a great time in House!!! <strong><em>-Stella (2G1) (Bronte)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>HOUSE has given me the opportunity to grow alongside others, learn by
doing, and make real connections. It’s all about working together on different
projects, helping each other out, and stepping up in ways that impacts
Crescent. Being a HOUSE leader has impacted me by pushing me to grow in
many different ways. It’s taught me how to manage responsibilities, work
closely with others, and take initiative. It’s been rewarding to see our
efforts make a real difference in Crescent. <strong><em>-Preetha (3C3) (Pankhurst)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Being part of HOUSE has been one of the most rewarding and memorable experiences
of my school life. From planning school-wide events like Champion Seminar
to the unforgettable Finale Games at House Camp 2023, I’ve shared countless
moments with my housemates that I truly cherish. Despite the challenges
and stress, the fun, teamwork, and sense of accomplishment always make
me want to do it all over again. Each event we organized wasn't just a
task to complete—it was an opportunity to grow, laugh, and create lasting
memories with people I now consider family. <strong><em>-Kaaviya (3S6) (Pankhurst)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>As a House Leader for the past 2 years, I have never once regretted joining
house. All the valuable experiences and events, like Champion Seminar and
Secondary 1 Orientation, I have taken part in and was involved in to organise
were memorable and special in their own ways. With each event, came various
challenges to overcome, props to make and timelines to plan. However, we
never gave up and always gave our best effort to make sure the event, as
well as our regular duties, is executed well. And lastly, the everlasting
friendship is what makes house a family. <strong><em>-Neha (3S6) (Curie)</em></strong>
</p>
<p>Being a house leader has been a fun and rewarding experience, especially
while planning events like X-country and Inter-House Games. Working with
my batchmates made it even more enjoyable as we are able to bond and build
teamwork, creating lasting memories that truly enriched this journey. <strong><em>-Hui En (3G5) (Keller)</em></strong>
