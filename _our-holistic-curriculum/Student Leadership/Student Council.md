<h2><strong>STUDENT COUNCIL</strong></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“AMBASSADORS OF CRESCENTIAN IDENTITY”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crescent’s Student Council is a student-led organisation whose mission
is to nurture passionate and kind lady leaders who possess a forward-looking
and positive mindset. Acting as the bridge between the student body and
the school leaders, our Student Councillors are driven to serve the student
body with passion, dedication and commitment. Through this, they develop
the heart to serve and guide others, and strive to display the five pillars
of servant leadership, PERMAH domains, and our council values Modesty,
Integrity and Courage (MIC) under any circumstance.</p>
<p>As ladies and leaders of tomorrow, the Student Council believes in serving
with dedication, commitment and love to ensure the well-being of our community.
Being the bridge of communication for the student body to the teachers
and school leaders, Student Councillors actively reach out to their peers
to hear their concerns through platforms like the Student Leaders’ Forum
as well as informal feedback settings within their classrooms, or when
mingling with schoolmates. After receiving these responses, appropriate
actions will be taken so as to address the issues raised, as Student Councillors
are constantly seeking to work with the teachers in improving the Crescent
experience.</p>
<p>Crescent’s Student Councillors take on a kaleidoscope of dynamic roles
in the varied job scope they fulfil. Through their various departments,
they extend their service as servant leaders to provide support and serve
the school holistically. Along with their fundamental role to uphold school
discipline standards through administrative duties like spot-check, class
cleanliness and latecoming reporting, they also lead the school community
through leadership nurturing activities for others and themselves. They
are also actively involved in organising school-wide events such as the
Student Leaders Investiture and Teachers’ Day Celebration.&nbsp;Such planning
and organising fuel our their creativity, providing them with the learning
experience of being able to plan more independently and to take intiative.</p>
<p>Leadership training goes beyond workshops held for them, but it also extends
to them attending peer teaching sessions on lessons about leadership from
the book: “Habitudes: Images that form Leadership Habits &amp; Attitudes”
by Dr Tim Alore. These trainings and workshops allow our Student Councillors
to be equipped with the heart of a servant leader and better demonstrate
the 5 leadership pillars in their everyday service to the school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all, the Student Council provides a wide range of activities to
groom our Student Councillors into leaders of the future – leaders anchored
with a heart of service.</p>

<p>Council has provided me with an enriching experience of growing as a leader
to serve the larger Crescentian community and beyond. It is through Council
that I have learned that leadership is an ever-evolving process of constantly
bettering oneself through putting in effort to grow ourselves. Before joining
Council, I was constantly apprehensive of having to work in a team with
others, but after having worked with so many wonderful batchmates and seniors
during the planning of events such as Investiture and Teachers’ Day, I
can see how I have grown to be an effective and contributing member of
a team, creatively synergising to achieve a common target. Council is a
safe environment to make mistakes and learn from them, guided by seniors
and batchmates who got your back through it all. <strong><em>- Chiam Chieh Leng Vanessa (4C2), Secondary 4 EXCO</em></strong>

<p>Being a part of the student council has been a meaningful and enriching
experience for me. The lessons, experiences, and values I have learnt have
taught me the importance of servant leadership and many core values such
as resilience, teamwork and innovativeness. Student Council has also taught
me the importance of good time management, as I had to plan my time to
be able to manage event planning tasks as well as my academics and other
commitments to the best of my ability. Student Council has shaped me into
a better servant leader, and has taught me that being a leader is more
than just a position. In conclusion, the time I have spent in council has
been a very valuable experience and has shaped me into a better version
of myself. <strong><em>- Hannah Ng (3C1)</em></strong>

<p>Student Council has provided me with many opportunities to grow and learn
as a person. Being in Student Council has allowed me to take on different
roles in event planning and this has enabled me to become a well-rounded
student in Crescent. One important thing that I have learnt since starting
as a councillor in Secondary Two is the importance of communicating effectively
with others, as well as being able to lead and step back at appropriate
times. I really enjoy being a part of the Student Council community as
everyone is very welcoming and understanding. Through Student Council,
I am able to become a better version of myself. <strong><em>- Shanice Ng (3G2), Sec 3 Vice President</em></strong>
