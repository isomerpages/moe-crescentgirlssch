**Secondary 1 English Programme**<br>
The Secondary One English Language programme focuses on equipping students with various skills that&nbsp; help them to become confident, skilled communicators. Learner-centred experiences allow students to explore how the language is used as a tool for self-expression. Students are exposed to authentic texts in various forms such as blogs, videos, podcasts, personal recounts, emails and letters. In exploring these texts, they are taught a wide range of skills which help them appreciate the art of written and spoken communication. There are numerous opportunities for collaborative work in the classroom to strengthen their foundation in standard English that is grammatical, fluent, intelligible and appropriate for different purposes, audiences, contexts and cultures.

In tandem with the Department’s focus on Effective Communication, students are exposed to the art of persuasion and given the platform for public speaking, which includes delivering a persuasive speech. Various formative assessments including peer assessments are used to help students grasp and incorporate techniques learnt in the classrooms into their speeches.

‘Talk Like Ted’ a public speaking programme designed for the cohort based on the book of the same title.

#### **Special Programmes**

**Lower Secondary English Literature Programme**<br>
Crescent’s Lower Secondary Literature programme is designed to immerse students in a profound exploration of a range of literary works focusing on the novel and poetry. Students are encouraged to respond to literary texts in a holistic manner to cover the 5 different Areas of Study (Plot and Structure; Character; Themes; Style and Setting and Atmosphere). Also incorporated in the curriculum is the use of multimedia tools to explore historical contexts relevant to the literary works being studied to enhance students’ learning experience. The programme hopes to foster in the students a deep appreciation of language, inspire critical thinking and to empower them to read text and the world in different ways and with discernment.

**For the Secondary 1 Literature programme, the students explore three genres:**<br>
1 - Short Stories<br>
2 - Short Plays<br>
3 - Unseen Poetry (by local and international poets)<br>

**For the Secondary 2 Literature programme, the students explore two genres:**<br>
1 - Novel: The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas by John Boyne<br>
2 - Unseen Poetry (by local and international poets)<br>

Our students also participate in events and competitions such as the National Schools

Literature Festival, a literary festival for students in Singapore, to provide them with a powerful platform to develop their passion and love for literature.

**Upper Secondary English Literature Programme**<br>
The Upper Secondary Literature programme comprises two major categories:  
  
Paper 1: Set Text (Novel/ Short Stories) – The Chrysalids by John Wyndham and Unseen Poetry  
Paper 2: Set Text (Drama) – A Raisin in the Sun by Lorraine Hansberry

Central to the study of Literature in the Upper Secondary is the holistic approach to the subject as well as developing in students the ability to respond critically to the text by building on their understanding of the five Areas of Study. At the Upper Secondary level, they are also exposed to texts that allow them to explore and make relevant connections to their own lives. Students will engage in a variety of tasks that will help them critically appreciate how the Areas of Study impact the readers’ experiences and to articulate their ideas in a clear and coherent way.

To enhance their learning experience, students participate in the National Schools Literature Festival, a national event which provides students from different schools studying similar texts with a platform to apply their knowledge of the text through debates. Such invaluable experiences enable students to hone their critical thinking and analytical skills as well as communication skills.
