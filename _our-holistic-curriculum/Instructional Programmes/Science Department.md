<h3><strong>Science Department</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Mission</strong></h4>
<p>To nurture curious and confident learners of tomorrow.</p>
<h4><strong>Vision</strong></h4>
<p>An inquiring Crescentian and an innovative Department.</p>
<h4><strong>Curriculum</strong></h4>
<p>The curriculum goals of Science department are referenced from the Science
Curriculum Framework. The goals are:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>To enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, which
can help them to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in
their daily lives.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To provide strong science foundations for students to innovate and pursue
STEM for future learning and work.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Special Programmes</strong></h4>
<p><strong>ICT-enabled Inquiry Based Learning</strong>
<br>Our science teachers are guided by Leahy’s AFL framework and e-pedagogy
to design Science learning experiences and learning activities that enable
Crescentians to acquire and develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions
as future-ready learners. A wide variety of learning experiences are designed
to promote acquisition of expertise and understanding, with emphasis on
the understanding and application of concepts and principles. Knowledge
Construction in a Science classroom is anchored by the active learning
processes with Technology – Activating Learning, Promoting Thinking and
Discussion, Facilitating Demonstration of Learning and Monitoring and Providing
Feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Mixed reality in Science</strong>
<br>Students immerse themselves in exciting gamified mixed reality (MR) lessons
to understand and visualize abstract Science concepts better. Through such
lessons, students get to collaborate and be involved in real-world problem
solving, and this increases students’ engagement level.</p>
<p>In Biology, students explore a virtual nuclear site to collect and analyze
samples. A nuclear site is not something that a student can just walk into
and experience, hence by harnessing on the MR technology, teachers bring
such valuable learning experience into the classroom in a safe environment
for students to explore.</p>
<p>In the Physics task, students are to solve a crisis management scenario
for an imminent earthquake/tsunami natural disaster. The use of mixed reality
help students to visualize the waves when used in conjunction with different
data-collecting instruments.</p>
<p>Such authentic tasks help students to map and better relate different
concepts in the chapter and see the real-world application of the concepts
learnt.</p>

<p><strong>Science Mentorship Program</strong>
<br>To develop interest and talents in the areas of Science amongst our students,
a group of them participated in the Science Mentorship Program jointly
organised by the Ministry of Education’s Gifted Education Branch and partners
from tertiary institutions and research agencies. Under the guidance of
their mentors, students work on their research projects, which they subsequently
showcase to an audience of peers, teachers and scientists in the Youth
Science Conference.</p>

<p><strong>Science Research Program</strong>
<br>Under the Science Research Programme, a group of enthusiastic students
with a keen interest in Science embarked on their journey as young reviewers
under the guidance of Dr Kerri McCrickerd.</p>
<p>Quote from our young reviewers: “Under this programme, we grew to be fascinated
by the process of reviewing articles. We also had the opportunity to enhance
our critical thinking and widen our perspectives by sharing our views with
a scientist. We had a fruitful journey as this reviewing process has enabled
us to explore something out of our curriculum.”</p>
<p>You may view their reviewed article for a scientific journal at Frontiers
For Young Minds at this <strong><a href="https://kids.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frym.2021.584941" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">link</a></strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Biology Learning Journey to Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum</strong>
</p>
<p>The Biology Learning Journey to the Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum
offered students a hands-on exploration of the natural world at the molecular
level. Using stereomicroscopes, students observed pollen grains, anthers
and filaments to deepen their understanding of plant biology. They also
learnt about fascinating bioluminescent arthropods. Additionally, students
utilised scanning electron microscopes to examine the intricate structures
of animal body coverings from sharks, owls, pythons, and sea stars. This
enriching experience provided a unique opportunity to engage with advanced
scientific equipment and explore the diversity of life in greater</p>

<p><strong>Learning Journey to i-Fly</strong>
<br>To further enrich students’ learning experience, students also went on
learning journeys. Upper Secondary Physics students embarked on a Learning
Journey to iFly Singapore, Singapore’s only indoor skydiving facility.
With the help of professional indoor skydiving instructors, the students
were able to experience flying in mid-air in the high-velocity vertical
wind tunnel. This Learning Journey sparked the joy of learning in the students
and they had the chance to experience what they have learnt in the Physics
classroom about kinematics and dynamics in action!</p>

<p><strong>Chemistry Learning Journey</strong>
<br>Chemistry Learning Journey is a valuable platform for our students to
bring learning outside their classrooms and experience the joy of learning.
In the Chemistry of Chocolate Workshop, students learned to compare and
evaluate the sensory properties and nutritional value of food, recognise
the effects of crystallization on physical properties of chocolate, recognise
compounds that are water-based or oil-based and recognise that some chemical
reactions are irreversible.</p>

<p><strong>Crystal Growing</strong>
<br>Two teams participated in the 16th Singapore National Crystal Growing
Challenge, a biennial event for secondary school, junior college and polytechnic
students. The students presented Ammonium Copper(II) Sulphate Hexahydrate
crystals and showcased their months of hard work at the NUS Chemistry Teaching
laboratories.</p>

<p><strong>Science Busking</strong>
<br>The 2024 Singapore Science Buskers competition showcased the talents of
young scientists from Crescent Girls' School, which sent 30 teams to participate.
These aspiring innovators worked diligently, crafting engaging presentations
that combined science with entertainment, making complex concepts accessible
and fun for the audience. Out of all the entries, four finalist teams emerged,
each demonstrating exceptional creativity and depth of understanding. The
final round took place at Bukit Panjang Plaza on 14 and 15 September, where
the energy was palpable as students passionately shared their projects.
Families, friends, and science enthusiasts gathered to support the competitors,
creating a vibrant atmosphere filled with curiosity and excitement. The
event not only highlighted the students' hard work but also fostered a
love for science in the community, inspiring the next generation of thinkers
and problem solvers. This year's competition was a testament to the power
of collaboration, creativity, and the joy of discovery.</p>
