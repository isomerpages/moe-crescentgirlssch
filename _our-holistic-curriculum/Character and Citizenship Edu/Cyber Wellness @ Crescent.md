<h3><strong>Cyber Wellness @ Crescent</strong></h3>
<p>The aim of the Cyber Wellness programme is to develop Crescentians into
discerning and responsible ICT users who are able to protect themselves
and be responsible for their well-being in the cyberspace.</p>
<p>The school adopts MOE’s Cyber Wellness Framework in educating our students
on Cyber Wellness. This framework focuses on three key processes: Sense,
Think and Act.</p>

<p>In order for the students to ‘sense’ and ‘think’, students are provided
opportunities to analyze, evaluate and reflect on Cyber Wellness issues.</p>

<p>Platforms are also provided to allow students to translate their understanding
into actions that will keep them safe while online. These platforms aim
to let students take on the role as advocates to share the messages of
Cyber Wellness with their peers, family and public.</p>
