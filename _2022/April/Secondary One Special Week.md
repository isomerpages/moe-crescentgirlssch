### **Secondary One Special Week**
Held from 28 Mar to 1 April 2022, the Secondary One Social Week which seeks to develop ruggedness, resilience and build social cohesion among our students, kicked-started with a 3-day Outdoor Adventure Camp at the MOE Dairy Farm Outdoor Adventure Learning Centre.

Upon arrival, we were led to the dormitory to enjoy games to strengthen our class bonds and make new friends. We also got to appreciate Nature by observing fishes and creating fish traps while having fun. Besides learning about the importance of teamwork we also cultivated significant life skills such as outdoor cooking and pitching tents that would enable us to survive in the wild! The hike to the quarry was amazing as we admired the beautiful and peaceful scenery. Despite the wet weather, we still had a fruitful and memorable time, bonding with classmates and honing our interpersonal skills. The Secondary One Special week wrapped up with a Pos-Ed workshop back in school for us to find out more about our own learning styles and to maintain a positive well-being among students.
