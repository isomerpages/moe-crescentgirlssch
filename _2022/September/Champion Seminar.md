### **Champion Seminar 2022** ###

For the past two years, Champion Seminar was reduced to a set of slides and souvenirs in our classrooms due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet despite having been on a two-year hiatus, House did not fail to bring honour in its return. The House leaders put in their blood, sweat, and tears to prepare for the event months before the actual day. Following the theme of Encanto, with the tagline “There is magic in all of us”, the hall was beautifully decorated with fairy lights draped across the hall, flower petals scattered across the stage and banners with intricate designs pasted on the doors, leaving all attendees in awe. The performers are not professional actresses, but they sacrificed their time to rehearse during the holidays and put on a spectacular, breath-taking show that was enjoyable to watch. The performances left viewers captivated, and they erupted into roars of applause at many scenes. The atmosphere was simply magical, fitting the theme of Encanto. Champion Seminar provided students with the opportunity to express their appreciation towards the members in their CCA, as well as show their immense gratitude towards their teachers and coaches. It was truly an enjoyable experience – for the teachers, students, and the House leaders.
