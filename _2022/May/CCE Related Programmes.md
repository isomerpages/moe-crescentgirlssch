### **CCE-related Programmes**
#### **Values in Action - KidsREAD**

KidsREAD is a reading programme by NLB to build a positive disposition in primary school students towards reading, and to develop the habit to read for pleasure and enjoyment. Crescent partners Blangah Rise Primary School to engage the Primary One and Two students in providing additional support for extensive reading for overall literacy development. This is part of the school’s Values In Action Programme where Secondary Three students volunteer commit to a 10-weeks involvement during Blended Learning days.

During each session, the Secondary Three students begin with a storytelling segment. This is followed by a series of book-related activities in Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and Mathematics to reinforce the key learning in the story. The session ends with independent reading where the Primary One and Two students are encouraged to select a book of their choice to read independently with their respective volunteers.

#### **Sec 4 Career Seminar**
After 2 years of online Career Seminar, the school was able to invite our long-lasting partners to once again come together for our inaugural Sec 4 Career Seminar. The girls were privileged to glean from the representatives of various Junior Colleges (JCs), Crescent alumni who are currently pursuing their higher learning education in JCs and Polytechnics, and successful alumni from various sectors such as Veterinary, Entrepreneurship and STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields. Also, the workshop on Joint Admission Exercise provides the opportunities for the girls to reflect and have conversations with their parents on their Joint Admission Exercise (JAE) and 12-choices IHL-admission considerations. In addition, the “Effective Communication and Interview Skills Workshop ” has equipped our girls with the necessary skills and dispositions in preparing for interviews and presentations.
