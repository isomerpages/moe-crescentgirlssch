### **Dedication Ceremony**
11 January 2022 marked a significant day in the school year at Crescent especially for the secondary 1s and new students from secondary 2 and 3 who were officially welcomed into the Crescentian family. During this special ceremony, Form Teachers were in their classes together with their students while the other members of the staff gathered in the hall to celebrate this special event virtually.

A speech by Mrs Helen Chong kick started the celebrations reminding us to face the challenges we faced confidently, setting the tone for the year to come. Mrs Chong then led the staff in reciting the Crescent Girlsâ€™ School staff Pledge.

I was touched to see the unity and love displayed among Crescentians as we cheered on our juniors during their initiation ceremony. It brought back so many sweet memories of my own inauguration ceremony.

As the special event came to a close, the President of the Student Council, Chin Rui-En, led the Crescentians in a pledge of commitment to the school, with each Crescentian promising to be courteous, sincere and generous at all times. Onward with zeal and zest, forward we of CGS!
