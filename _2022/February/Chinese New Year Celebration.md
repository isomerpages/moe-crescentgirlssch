### **Chinese New Year Celebration**
31 Jan 2022 was indeed a memorable day for Crescentians as we celebrated Chinese New Year. Not only were we treated to tasty snacks provided by the Parent Support Group, which included bubble tea and a toothsome sugar roll, we also got to enjoy listening to Mrs Chong’s recitation of a heartfelt poem which she composed specially for the occasion. We were then entertained by the Chinese and Modern Dance Club and the Angklung and Kulintang Ensemble, both of which put up impressive performances which had us gasping in awe every few moments. We were also given the opportunity to demonstrate our creativity as all of us had a go at making origami tigers. While half of the class marvelled at their paper creations, others who struggled with the origami still admired whatever they had created. The highlight of this year’s celebration came in the form of a kahoot game where we listened to recordings of songs being sung by teachers and we had to identify the teachers. We had intense discussions and enjoyed ourselves immensely.

This year’s celebration was a resounding success. Everyone enjoyed the festive spirit, and on the eve of the new year, everyone felt renewed and ready to face the year with the tiger spirit! Gong Xi Fa Cai!
