### **Time Capsule for CG100**
We will be sealing a new time capsule soon; this time the capsule will be opened in 2056 at CG100, Crescent’s centenary year. The last time capsule included items from the period 1965 – 1995. So for the next time capsule, we would like to include iconic items from 1996 to 2021. We need your suggestions on what to include inside! Leave your suggestions in this link [**HERE**](https://form.gov.sg/#!/612309f92eb97f0012e3923d) today!
