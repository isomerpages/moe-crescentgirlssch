### **Youth Day Celebrations**
Youth Day 2022 was held on the 12th of July. A day celebrating our individuality, Youth Day served as a reminder of how each and every one of us is unique, with different strengths and weaknesses that we use to complement one another. There are things that only we can do, and they are what make us unique and special. As part of the Youth Day festivities, the students enjoyed a class picnic, with each level savouring different types of food, from sandwiches from Subway, to bubble tea from Liho and Koi. Students bonded with their classmates over scrumptious meals. Cheerful chatter and music poured from classrooms, and some classes even chose to have impromptu karaoke sessions! The day ended off with a bang, leaving everyone in high spirits.
