### **Student Leaders' Investiture**
On 28 June 2022, Crescent celebrated our annual Student Leaders’ Investiture. This significant event aims to acknowledge the numerous students who worked hard behind the scenes to serve our school. Inspired by a phrase from a poem by Dr Seuss, "Oh, The Places You Will Go!" was selected as this year’s theme.

Although the investiture was conducted in the classrooms, an inspiring and empowering speech by Mrs Chong, combined with the enthusiastic applause of supportive Crescentians still allowed our student leaders to feel welcomed into their various leadership groups. Afterwards, souvenirs were given to the student leaders to affirm the contributions and sacrifices they have made to make events such as this a success.

At the end of the day, leadership is more than a title - it is an attitude. While the investiture served as the formal closure for the Secondary Four leaders, their personal leadership journeys continue. We believe that this is merely the beginning of many other journeys and accomplishments. It was also an event to inspire the incoming student leaders and to motivate them to lead with excellence and character. Even with the investiture coming to an end, everyone left with a warm feeling in their hearts. It was a joyous day filled with celebration as we honoured the ladies and leaders of tomorrow.
