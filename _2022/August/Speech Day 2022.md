### **Speech Day 2022**
Crescent Girls School, which turns 66 this year, is more than a school for our Crescentians. The fact that Crescent alumni make up a sizeable proportion of our teaching and non-teaching staff is testimony to the strong ties which many ex-Crescentians have with their alma mater. It is the Crescentian experience which unites Crescentian family members past and present. This experience unites us in spirit as we reminisce and savour precious memories made with friends in school even as CGS celebrates her 66th anniversary. It is for this reason that our CG66 celebration this year is aptly themed CG United.
