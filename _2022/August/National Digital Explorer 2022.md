### **National Digital Explorer 2022**
National Digital Explorer 

Crescent Girls’ School (CGS) partnered ICDL in organising the National Digital Explorer (NDE) initiative. The initiative empowers students through the development of practical digital skills for the workplace. Under the initiative, there were two tracks teachers could select for their students: Learn and Learn &amp; Apply. Through the Learn programme, students were able to become self-directed learners and equip themselves with essential Microsoft skills. Through the Learn &amp; Apply programme, students would then apply what they have learnt in the modules to receive certification from ICDL Asia. More than 10 000 students from almost 50 intuitions of learning participated in the initiative.

Based on the results who participated in the Learn &amp; Apply programme, the top students were invited to participate in the final round on 5 August 2022, where they would compete against one another. CGS hosted the final round, which saw the attendance of almost 100 students from 19 schools. The students range from upper primary students to upper secondary students, and also includes students from international schools. Minister of State, Ms Gan Siow Huang who graced the event emphasized in her address the need to embrace a digital future by reimagining teaching and learning with technology.

Ms Gan and Mr Damien O’Sullivan, CEO of ICDL Foundation, presented the awards to the winners. ALIA SHAKIRA BINTE MASZLAN of 1G2 and SAHOO SHRESTHA of 1C1 did the school proud by securing the Bronze and Gold award respectively.

&nbsp;**“In a nutshell, the competition has not only familiarised me with the different functions of Microsoft Word and PowerPoint, it has also built my confidence in creating presentation slides and documents that are appealing. I am sure the practical skills gained will have a far-reaching impact on my future.”&nbsp;_by Alia Shakira (1G2)_**

**“I feel that with the advancement in technology in our modern world, we need these skills to get through our work life. I was elated that I had attained a Gold in the competition, but I was more elated that I had learned a lot of new skills which will definitely be useful in the real world.”&nbsp;_by Sahoo Shrestha (1C1)_**
