<h3><strong>Discipline Philosophy and School Rules</strong></h3>
<p>Crescent Girls’ School adopts a positive and pro-active approach to Discipline.
The school believes that a caring and enabling school environment for all,
marked by student discipline and a culture of respect for self, peers and
teachers, is necessary for learning to take place.</p>
<p>Discipline is an educative process to guide students to develop self-management,
responsibility, and good character. Disciplinary measures help students
to learn that there are consequences for their inappropriate behaviours
and actions and take responsibility not to repeat their mistakes.</p>
<p>The school is committed to helping all students to manage themselves and
cultivate self-discipline, sound values and a strong sense of responsibility
so that they will, in their pursuit of excellence, become ladies and leaders
of tomorrow.</p>
