<h3><strong>Discipline Philosophy And School Rules</strong></h3>
<p>Crescent Girls’ School believes that a safe and orderly school environment,
marked by student discipline and a culture of respect for self, peers and
teachers, is necessary for learning to take place. The school is committed
to helping all students to manage themselves and cultivate self-discipline,
sound values and a strong sense of responsibility so that they will, in
their pursuit of excellence, become ladies and leaders of tomorrow.</p>
<p>Students are expected to adhere to the school rules on:</p>
<p><strong>(A) National Anthem and Pledge</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

</li>
<li>
<p>Students who are Singapore Citizens must sing the National Anthem and
take the Pledge.&nbsp;Students will take the Pledge with the right fist
over the heart.</p>

<h4>The Merit and Demerit System</h4>
<p>Students who demonstrate exemplary character and values through their
behaviour and actions are recognised through MOE and school-based awards
such as the Edusave Character Award, School Merit Award and Honour Points.
These awards aim to positively reinforce desired behaviours and actions,
recognise students who would serve as role models to others and are used
in consideration of student conduct grades and preparation of their School
Graduation Certificates.</p>
<p>The school has clear guidelines to manage student misdemeanours. Consequences
include verbal warning, demerit points, restitution, detention session
and counselling. Recognising that parents play a key role in their children’s
development, the school will engage parents to provide the necessary home
support and reinforcement to enable students to grow from their disciplinary
challenges so that they may flourish into disciplined and responsible members
of society.</p>
