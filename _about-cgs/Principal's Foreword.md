Crescent Girls’ School has come a long way since its beginnings in 1956. From the time of its founding, Crescent has been providing a nurturing and innovative environment for generations of students to be gracious, confident ladies and caring visionary leaders. Under the fine stewardship of Principal Mrs Helen Chong, the school has flourished as she led the staff and partnered our stakeholders in blazing new trails for our students to discover new learning opportunities that enable them to be Ladies and Leaders of Tomorrow who believe in themselves and what the future can offer them. We thank Mrs Chong for modelling the way in servant leadership and wish her all the best in her retirement!

It is my privilege to work alongside the staff and stakeholders as we strive for continuous growth and innovation, and help our students to prepare themselves well for the future. In my interactions with the students, staff, parents, and the members of the School Advisory Committee and the Alumni Association, it is evident that there is a strong sense of community and culture of care among the members of the Crescentian family. I am deeply touched by the warmth and generosity extended to me. In both words and actions, the staff and students embody the values that Crescent espouses, and this attests to the strong heritage, school culture and values that others have come to know the school for. 

Education in Crescent has always been guided by our school vision, mission and motto. Moving forward, our focus will continue to be on holistic education for our students with a strong emphasis on the development of strength of character and leadership. At Crescent, we believe in developing in our students the confidence and competencies to not only manage the challenges but also leverage the opportunities that the future offers. We adopt a student-centred approach in designing our curriculum and student development experiences to engage our students actively and meaningfully in their learning. Through these, they develop critical competencies and learning dispositions that enable them to navigate the future, and values that guide them in making good decisions as responsible members of society and gracious citizens of the world. 
 
As the saying goes, it takes a village to raise a child. We are grateful to have a strong community of staff, parents, School Advisory Committee (SAC), Alumni and partners – both past and present – who support the school’s efforts in developing our students. Our teachers and support staff are dedicated and passionate in nurturing our students. The parents are supportive, and in particular, the members of our Parent Support Group (PSG) tirelessly partner the school in various programmes and activities. Our SAC and Alumni are generous in providing their expertise and resource support in improving the learning environment and enhancing the school experience for our students. In addition, our community and educational partners provide additional valuable learning experiences for our students. Together, we will provide our students with a caring and supportive environment where they can experience the joy of learning, thrive and succeed.  

***May 2025 be a joyful and fulfilling year for all of us!***
