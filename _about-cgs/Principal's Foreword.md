Established in 1956, Crescent Girls’ School has been providing a nurturing and innovative environment for generations of students to be gracious, confident ladies and caring visionary leaders. Education in Crescent will always reflect the confidence we have in our students’ ability, and our aim to prepare students for the challenges of the future. We continually blaze new trails for our students to discover new learning opportunities that will enable them to be wholesome individuals who believe in themselves and what the future can offer them.

At Crescent, there is a healthy emphasis on both curricular and co-curricular programmes. In developing our students to become excellent and well-balanced scholars, we adopt a student-centred approach in pedagogy, integrate higher-order thinking skills and provide many opportunities for students to learn collaboratively. To groom them into responsible members of society and gracious citizens of the world, strong emphasis is placed on the development of strength of character, mindset of excellence, commitment to teamwork, leadership potential, and other 21st century skills and dispositions.

In recognition of our excellent holistic curriculum and ability to harness technology to bring about engaged learning, the school has been selected as one of the first few FutureSchools@Singapore. We were also conferred the School Excellence Award – the pinnacle award granted by the Ministry of Education. These and other accolades are only possible with the wholehearted efforts of our team of committed and talented staff who relentlessly forge innovative ways to develop in students a passion for learning and for life.

This website gives you a glimpse of the Crescentian learning experience which empowers students to realise their potential as ladies and leaders of tomorrow. We welcome you to be part of this exciting experience.

Mrs Helen Chong<br>
Principal
