<br>

Oh, let us join our school to praise,<br>
Sing blithe and gay and free,<br>
Resolve to follow courteous ways,<br>
And ever truthful be.<br>
To study hard and play with zest,<br>
To always strive to do our best.<br>
Sincere in all our living<br>
And generous in our giving.<br><br>

Our school colours yellow and blue,<br>
Mean ideals good and clean.<br>
The lotus emblem pure and true,<br>
Forever makes us keen.<br>
To cherish our Alma Mater,<br>
Now and forever later.<br>
Onward with zeal and zest,<br>
Forward we of CGS.<br><br>

And though of diverse creeds we be,<br>
Together we must work.<br>
Without a trace of jealousy,<br>
Our aim is not to shirk.<br>
In Maths or Science or Geography,<br>
Or games which make us fit and free.<br>
The day when we must part,<br>
May Crescent remain in our hearts.
