### **International Students**
MOE conducts a centralised admission exercise around Sept/October every year for new international students who wish to join our mainstream public schools in January of the following year. This exercise – the Admissions Exercise for International Students (AEIS) – will involve a centralised test on English and Mathematics, and applicants who pass the test will be offered a place in a suitable school.

Further details of the centralised admissions exercise are available at the following website:<br>
