<h3><strong>Admission after PSLE</strong></h3>
<p>Upon the release of the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results
in late November, pupils graduating from Singapore primary schools are
to indicate their six secondary school choices during the Secondary One
Option Exercise centrally conducted by the Ministry of Education (MOE).
The posting will be processed by MOE based on pupils’ PSLE score and choices,
and the results are usually out in mid/late December each year.</p>
<h5><strong>Q1: What is the school’s cut-off PSLE?</strong></h5>
<p>The cut-off PSLE score for admission into our school at Secondary One
in 2025 is 10 (PG3) and 23 (PG2).</p>
<h5><strong>Q2: What if I miss the cut-off score?</strong></h5>
<p>We are unable to accept appeals from applicants whose PSLE score does
not meet our cut-off score for the Secondary One Posting Exercise. If your
PSLE score is same or better than our cut-off score and wishes to appeal
to our school, you can submit an <strong><a href="https://form.gov.sg/655c61bdb6f4b70012408d6e" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Appeal Form</a> </strong>with
photocopies of the relevant documents for consideration. The outcome of
appeal will be made known to you as and when there is an available vacancy.</p>
<h5><strong>Q3: Is the school affiliated to any primary school?</strong></h5>
<p>No.</p>
<h5><strong>Q4: How has the school performed academically?</strong></h5>
<p>Traditionally, our students have excelled academically at national examinations
with value-added performance.</p>
<h5><strong>Q5: Does the school offer Higher Mother Tongue?</strong></h5>
<p>We offer Higher Chinese, Higher Malay and Higher Tamil, and lessons are
held within the school during curriculum time.</p>
