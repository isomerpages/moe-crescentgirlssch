### **Admission after PSLE**
Upon the release of the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results in late November, pupils graduating from Singapore primary schools are to indicate their six secondary school choices during the Secondary One Option Exercise centrally conducted by the Ministry of Education (MOE). The posting will be processed by MOE based on pupils’ PSLE score and choices, and the results are usually out in mid/late December each year.

##### **Q1: What is the school’s cut-off PSLE?**
The cut-off PSLE score for admission into our school at Secondary One in 2024 is 11 (PG3) and 25 (PG2).

##### **Q2: What if I miss the cut-off score?**
We are unable to accept appeals from applicants whose PSLE score does not meet our cut-off score for the 2023 Secondary One Posting Exercise. If your PSLE score is same or better than our cut-off score and wishes to appeal to our school, you can submit an&nbsp;**[Appeal Form](https://form.gov.sg/655c61bdb6f4b70012408d6e)**&nbsp;with photocopies of the relevant documents for consideration. The outcome of appeal will be made known to you as and when there is an available vacancy.

##### **Q3: Is the school affiliated to any primary school?**
No.

##### **Q4: How has the school performed academically?**
Traditionally, our students have excelled academically at national examinations with value-added performance.

##### **Q5: Does the school offer Higher Mother Tongue?**
We offer Higher Chinese, Higher Malay and Higher Tamil, and lessons are held within the school during curriculum time.

#### **NOTE**
**Appeal for School Transfer (Primary 6 pupils)<br>
(applicable after the release of Secondary 1 Posting Results)**
Primary 6 pupils who have applied to Crescent Girls’ School during MOE’s Secondary 1 Posting Exercise but are unsuccessful, may appeal to be considered for transfer to Crescent Girls’ School. These students appealing for admission to CGS after the release of the Secondary 1 Posting result have to meet the school’s cut-off score.

(\*Note: Students admitted to a school through the DSA-Sec Exercise will not be allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results. They are expected to honour the commitment to the posted DSA school for the duration of the programme admitted to.)

**Application period**<br>
The application period is from 21 Dec 2022 day of release of Secondary 1 Posting results to 27 Dec 2022, 12pm<br>
Late or incomplete application will not be considered. Only shortlisted applicants will be informed.
