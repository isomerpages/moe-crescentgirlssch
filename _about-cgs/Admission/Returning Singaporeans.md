### **Returning Singaporeans**
There is a centralised exercise conducted by MOE for Returning Singaporeans and new Permanent Residents. To take part in the School Placement Exercise for Returning Singaporeans (SPERS), Returning Singaporeans can sit for a set of centralised papers and be posted to a secondary school based on their performance in the papers, available vacancies and their school choices. The SPERS-Sec Exercise covers Sec 1 to Sec 3. The SPERS test will be held around Sept/Oct for children seeking admission to Sec 1 – 3 in the following year.

Further details of SPERS can be found at the following website:<br>

Returning Singaporeans who wish to seek admission to the school at other times of the year may direct enquiries to the school email address at [crescentgirl@moe.edu.sg](mailto:crescentgirl@moe.edu.sg).
