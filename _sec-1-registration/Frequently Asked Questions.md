<h4><strong>Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB) for Secondary 1 Parents</strong></h4>
<p><strong>1. What is Full SBB?</strong>
<br>Full SBB allows students to take each subject at a level that matches
their strengths, interests, and learning needs. It moves away from fixed
streams and offers greater flexibility in subject choices.</p>
<p><strong>2. How are students placed in Secondary 1?</strong>
<br>Students are posted to Secondary 1 through three Posting Groups (PG1,
PG2, PG3), based on their PSLE scores. Posting Groups help guide initial
subject levels but do not define a student’s identity or future pathways.</p>
<p><strong>3. What are subject levels (G1, G2, G3)?</strong>
<br>Subjects are offered at three levels:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>G1 (mapped from N(T))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G2 (mapped from N(A))</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>G3 (mapped from Express)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Students can take different subjects at different levels according to
their abilities.</p>
<p><strong>4. Can my child take subjects at a more demanding level?</strong>
<br>Yes. If eligible, students can offer English, Mother Tongue, Mathematics,
and Science at a higher level from Secondary 1. Humanities subjects can
be taken at a higher level from Secondary 2 onwards as students will need
time to adapt to the rigour of these new subjects.</p>

<p><strong>5. How does subject level flexibility work?</strong>
<br>Students may adjust their subject levels during their secondary school
journey, based on school-based results and teacher recommendations. The
school will reach out to parents should students be eligible for subjects
at a more demanding level.</p>
<p><strong>6. What are mixed form classes? What does it look like in Crescent Girls’ School?</strong>
<br>Students are placed in mixed form classes in lower secondary, giving them
opportunities to interact with peers of different strengths and backgrounds.</p>
<p><strong>7. What are the common curriculum subjects?</strong>
<br>All students take six common subjects with their form class: Art, Design
&amp; Technology, Food &amp; Consumer Education, Music, Physical Education,
and Character &amp; Citizenship Education. In CGS, students will also take
Lower Secondary Computer Education Programme (LSCEP) as a common curriculum
subject to develop strong digital literacy and future-ready skills.</p>
<p><strong>8. What happens after Secondary 1?</strong>
<br>Students generally progress to Secondary 2. The school will determine
suitable subjects and levels for each student.</p>
<p><strong>9. What are the post-secondary pathways?</strong>
<br>Students can access a range of post-secondary options (ITE, Polytechnic,
Millennia Institute, Junior College) depending on their subject levels
and results. Admission criteria have been updated to recognise different
subject combinations.</p>
<p><strong>10. How can I support my child?</strong>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">

<p>Learn about your child’s strengths and interests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage open discussions about education and career options.</p>
